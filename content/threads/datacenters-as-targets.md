blurb: 'Commercial datacentres are now deliberately struck in wartime, with published
  damage assessment — the first time. Iran hit AWS sites in the UAE (03-01) and Bahrain
  (04-01), claimed further strikes ~07-21, and satellite imagery corroborated damage
  at Zallaq and Askar on 07-28; Iranian state media named Microsoft, Google, Apple,
  Meta, Oracle, Intel and Nvidia as targets on 03-31. This is a STRUCTURAL VARIABLE,
  not an episode: it puts a war-risk term on siting, insurance and sovereign exposure
  across every capex thread we run, and none of them price it. Watch: further strikes
  or credible threats; whether any hyperscaler discloses it in a filing or on a call
  (Amazon reports 07-30 — the first live test); war-risk underwriting and premia for
  datacentre assets; siting decisions that cite geopolitical risk; and whether the
  precedent outlives this particular war, which is the thread''s main mortality risk.'

## 2026-09-23 — A Russian strike on Kyiv damages two internet providers' data centers

- **Russian strikes on Kyiv on the morning of 09-23 damaged data centers run by the internet providers Pavutyna and UTELS, leaving about 100,000 households in the capital region with unstable internet, Ukraine's Ministry of Digital Transformation said.** UTELS said the data center holding its core network equipment lost power and Pavutyna said its engineers were working to restore connectivity; the same attack killed two people and wounded about 25, according to Kyiv's mayor. ([Interfax-Ukraine](https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/1208652-amp.html), [UA.NEWS](https://ua.news/en/ukraine/rosiiska-ataka-zalishila-blizko-100-tisiach-domogospodarstv-u-kiievi-ta-oblasti-bez-stabilnogo-internetu))
- **Russian strikes overnight into 09-24 hit more data centers in Kyiv, destroying CityHost.UA equipment and the Ukrainian data center that housed MiroHost's capacity, a day after strikes damaged the Pavutyna and UTELS facilities.** Ukraine's telecom regulator warned of temporary network disruptions; KIEVNET, Domonet, FAUST and Crazy Network (which said a missile hit a central traffic-exchange data center) reported outages, CityHost said it was rushing to deploy backups on equipment abroad, and MiroHost said about 95% of its clients are outside Ukraine and unaffected.

## 2026-09-18 — AWS confirms permanent data loss at Bahrain, no restoration before 2027; the UAE responds by redesigning its flagship AI campus around the strike risk

- **AWS posted its first public update since April on its own health dashboard (2026-09-15): it cannot restore access to resources and data hosted exclusively in its Bahrain region, and separately cannot recover one of three affected UAE availability zones (mec1-az2).** Direct quote: "After a thorough assessment, we have determined that we are unable to restore access to the resources and data hosted exclusively in this region." AWS said the Bahrain damage "spanned multiple Availability Zones and exceeded what our regional and multi-AZ services are designed to withstand" — the company's own words confirming the strikes beat the design tolerance of a multi-AZ region, not just a single site. Bahrain customers get their next update in early 2027; the two other UAE zones remain under repair with updates promised "in the coming months." Most customers had already migrated workloads or restored from backup after the March strikes, per AWS, but this is the first confirmation that some resources and data are gone for good, seven and a half months after the attacks and directly on this thread's own "whether any hyperscaler discloses it" watch line. ⚠️ **The widely-recirculating "$150 million loss, insurance won't cover it" figure (Yahoo Finance, Moneywise, AOL and others, all published under September-looking URLs) is not new reporting** — the underlying Yahoo Finance piece carries a machine-readable publish date of 2026-04-24; it is the same aggregator-recycling pattern this map has flagged before on this exact story, not a fresh disclosure. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/09/15/aws-cant-restore-service-to-bahrain-uae-6-months-after-iran-strikes.html), [Insurance Journal](https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2026/09/16/885283.htm))
- **Separately, Reuters reported (2026-09-11) that the UAE is quietly redesigning its flagship 5-gigawatt Stargate AI campus — one of the largest AI infrastructure projects outside the US, a joint venture of OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank — specifically because of the strikes.** Originally planned as a single 10-square-mile Abu Dhabi campus, the project will now likely be a dispersed network of smaller sites; measures under consideration include underground construction, blast-resistant materials, backup power/cooling, drone- and missile-defense equipment, and siting the most sensitive facilities inside mountains. This is exactly the "siting decisions that cite geopolitical risk" this thread's watch line has been waiting to see, and the first case of it landing on a named, dollar-figured flagship project (Stargate UAE's first phase is $30bn/1GW) rather than a generic industry-wide warning. ([Reuters, via U.S. News](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2026-09-11/exclusive-uae-revises-ai-data-center-plan-after-iranian-attacks-sources-say))
- **Insurance broker Howden reported that data-centre capacity within 10 to 15 kilometres of active conflict zones in 2025 equalled about 60% of everything recorded in the previous five years combined, after Iranian drones struck five data centres in the UAE and Bahrain earlier this year.** Howden urged insurers to align cyber, property and war policy wording as data-centre risk turns physical as well as digital, and separately counted large data-centre lawsuits rising from four in 2021 to 14 in the first half of 2026, mostly planning and noise disputes. Coverage of the research began on 09-18.

## 2026-07-30 — The thread's own live test came back: no disclosure

*Logged 2026-08-18 by the cold rotation, nineteen days after the answer
became available. This thread named Amazon's 07-30 earnings as "the first
live test" of whether any hyperscaler would disclose the strikes.*

- **Amazon disclosed nothing. Not in the 10-Q, not on the call.** Checked
  directly against both primary documents: the Form 10-Q for the quarter
  ended 2026-06-30 and the 2026-07-30 Q2 earnings-call transcript contain
  **no mention of Iran, drones, missiles, Bahrain, the UAE, war risk, or
  physical attacks on AWS facilities** — not in risk factors, not in legal
  proceedings, not anywhere in the call.
  ([Amazon 10-Q](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001018724/000101872426000026/amzn-20260630.htm))
- **What makes the null meaningful is that AWS did acknowledge the
  strikes — to reporters, through a spokesperson, at the time they
  happened.** A PR-channel acknowledgement and a securities-filing
  disclosure are different acts with different consequences, and the gap
  between them is now on the record for this thread. The war-risk term
  this thread argues sits unpriced across every capex thread is, on this
  evidence, also undisclosed.
- **First commercial response to the vector:** a Y Combinator-backed
  startup launched a missile-intercepting drone-defence service marketed
  to data centres and grid operators (2026-08-06). Adjacent: the FT
  reported 2026-08-17 that Meta and BlackRock's $14bn data centre
  "exposes lenders to insurance gap" — financing-structure risk rather
  than war-risk premia specifically, but the first sign of lenders
  pricing physical exposure at all.
- **⚠️ Not new, recorded so it is not re-counted:** the 07-28→30 wave of
  "satellite imagery confirms Amazon Bahrain data center hit" coverage
  re-reports the same 07-28 corroboration already in this thread.


## 2026-08-03 — Strike toll widens to "at least five"; first named underwriters go on record on war-risk pricing

- **CNN reports the running toll has widened to "at least five" data
  centers struck in the Gulf region**, framing it as *both* Iran and the
  US hitting data centers in this war — not only Iran striking Western
  hyperscalers — a wider framing than this thread has carried so far;
  Amazon's Bahrain facility has now been hit twice (04-30 and 07-21). The
  same report cites an IRGC target list of 29 regional tech sites naming
  Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Nvidia **and Palantir** — Palantir wasn't in
  this thread's recorded 03-31 name set, worth verifying against the
  original Tasnim/Fars list rather than treating as confirmed-new (CNN's
  citation may just be an abbreviated subset of the same 29).
  ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2026/08/03/business/ai-data-centers-iran-war-oil))
- **First named underwriters on record about war-risk pricing** — the
  exact effect this thread has been watching for: Marsh's US property
  digital-infrastructure lead Joe Macejak said "some clients are looking
  at recent events and they're thinking twice about whether they move
  forward, and some insurers aren't comfortable taking on certain
  risks"; MSIG USA's property head Philip Wray said data centers are
  "giant warehouses with really expensive equipment inside" with limited
  hardening options. First sourced confirmation of insurance-market
  reaction, not yet a filed premium number.
  ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2026/08/03/business/ai-data-centers-iran-war-oil))
- **Checked and ruled out: Amazon's Q2 earnings call (reported ~07-30)
  did not address the Bahrain strikes.** CFO Brian Olsavsky's only
  Middle East mention was generic ("heightened transportation costs
  driven by fuel inflation from the conflict in the Middle East") — no
  reference to AWS facilities, Bahrain or Iran by name. Closes this
  thread's "first live disclosure test" watch item with a negative
  finding, not a disclosure.

## 2026-07-29 — Opened

- **Opened on Ben's steer** ("A. Yes. add it.") after the story surfaced
  with no owner — it had been landing across [Datacenter Sites](/threads/ai-datacenter-sites/),
  [AWS Capex](/threads/aws-capex/) and [Red Sea Shock](/threads/red-sea-oil-shock/), none of which could carry it as a
  standing variable. Scoped to **physical targeting of compute
  infrastructure**; the cyber/sabotage angle is adjacent and would widen
  it.

## 2026-07-28 — Satellite imagery corroborates the strikes on AWS Bahrain

- **Imagery shows significant damage to two Amazon data centres in
  Bahrain** — **Zallaq** and **Askar** — corroborating IRGC claims
  released via Tasnim.
  ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-07-28/amazon-data-centers-hit-in-iran-strikes-satellite-images-show)
  · [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/data-centers/amazon-data-center-in-bahrain-struck-and-destroyed-by-iranian-cruise-missiles-state-media-claims-attacks-launched-against-aws-site-in-response-to-alleged-us-strikes-on-an-under-construction-nuclear-plant))
- **⚠ The imagery is the 07-28 development, not the attack.** The strikes
  were claimed around **07-21**. Recorded as corroboration of an older
  event — the distinction matters because the campaign, not the incident,
  is what this thread tracks.
- **Landed the same day Iran struck a US base in Jordan** (5:45pm ET, all
  intercepted) — the first ballistic-missile attack on a US base since the
  07-24 pause. Compute infrastructure and conventional military targets in
  the same 24 hours.
- **Caught by the broad collector sweep, not the cluster agents** — all
  four tier-2/3 agents were pointed at memory, macro and mental health and
  missed it. The recall lesson is logged in coverage-log.md.

## 2026-04-01 — A further drone strike on Amazon in Bahrain

- **An Iranian drone struck an Amazon data centre in Bahrain** (FT).

## 2026-03-31 — Iran names its corporate target list

- **Iranian state media said it would target American companies
  including Microsoft, Google, Apple, Meta, Oracle, Intel, HP, IBM, Cisco,
  Dell, Palantir and Nvidia** — the declaration that turns individual
  strikes into a stated campaign.

## 2026-03-01 — The first strikes: AWS sites in the UAE

- **Before dawn, Iranian Shahed drones struck two Amazon Web Services
  data centres in the United Arab Emirates**; a third commercial data
  centre in Bahrain was hit, though whether it was deliberately targeted
  is less clear. Reported as the first time a country has deliberately
  targeted commercial data centres in wartime.
