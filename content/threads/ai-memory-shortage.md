blurb: 'The data-center buildout is diverting wafer capacity to HBM — a reported THREE-YEAR
  HBM deficit — spiking DRAM/NAND prices and forcing consumer-hardware price hikes
  (Apple, Microsoft). Now also the capacity-race ledger (backlog W5: widened here,
  not a new thread): Samsung/SK Hynix/Micron expansion responses, CXMT''s state-funded
  push (charging ABOVE Samsung; new modules with no price relief; DoD ban overhang),
  and who blinks first on capex.'

## 2026-08-27 — $31bn of Japanese NAND, on a six-year horizon against a shortage felt now

- **Kioxia and Sandisk said they will invest more than $31 billion in Japanese
  NAND flash capacity through 2032** — Yokkaichi and Kitakami plus a new Iwate
  fab — contingent on Japanese government support and framed explicitly as a
  response to AI-driven memory demand. **This is the supply-side answer to the
  constraint Nvidia priced into its margin guidance the night before, and the
  mismatch is the point**: a six-year build against a shortage that is moving
  prices now. It describes the shape of the problem rather than resolving it.

## 2026-08-26 — The squeeze shows up in Nvidia's own margin line

- **Nvidia guided Q3 FY2027 gross margin to 74.0% ±50bps, down from 75.0%,
  with rising HBM and DRAM input costs the stated pressure.** Trade reporting
  adds that Nvidia has told AI-server makers to expect price increases above
  15% on systems shipping in early 2027 — ⚠️ that figure traces only to trade
  coverage, not to any Nvidia statement, and is carried as unverified.
  **This is the first time this thread has seen the memory squeeze priced
  rather than forecast**, and it is priced in the margin of the company best
  placed to pass it on.

## 2026-08-24 — The market re-reads the >15% price rise as demand risk rather than pricing power

- ⚠️ **The new fact today is the READING, not the price rise — the price rise itself is already on this thread, dated 08-22.** Nvidia's notice to contract manufacturers that AI-server prices rise **more than 15%** on systems shipping in early 2027, blamed on DRAM and HBM costs, was logged on the 08-23 page. **It resurfaced today as the stated driver of a semiconductor selloff**, and that is a different datum: the same disclosure that read as cost pass-through three days ago is now being read as **demand-softening risk**. Micron, SanDisk and Western Digital each fell more than 5% and the SOXX ETF dropped 3–4% in a session where the Dow rose.

  <!-- ⚠️ CORRECTED IN-RUN, 2026-08-24 15:00 ET. This block was first
       written as though the >15% price rise were new today. It is not —
       it is an 08-22 event already recorded on the 08-23 page, resurfacing
       in today's market commentary. Caught by cross-checking
       attention/actor-doing.yaml's nvidia entry, which already carried it.
       Exactly the re-index trap this map keeps catching in other people's
       feeds, caught here in its own drafting. -->

## 2026-08-23 — Hot Chips answers Micron's memory-wall math with three separate engineering fixes

- **Micron's Raghu Sreeramaneni told Hot Chips 2026 that compute is
  scaling roughly 3x every two years while HBM bandwidth scales only
  about 2x — so the memory wall is widening, not closing.** Presented as
  "Evolving Memory Architectures for AI" on day one of the conference at
  Stanford (08-23 to 08-25). This is the technical floor under the 08-22
  capex story below: if bandwidth structurally trails compute, the memory
  premium Nvidia blamed its >15% server price rise on is not a cycle to
  wait out.
  ([ServeTheHome — conference coverage](https://www.servethehome.com),
  [Hot Chips 2026 programme](https://hotchips.org))
  <!-- Relayed via conference coverage, not a Micron press release; the
       08-23 date is confirmed against Hot Chips' own published schedule. -->
- **Day two produced three separate engineering answers to that same
  wall. Samsung unveiled zHBM, stacking memory directly atop the compute
  die**, claiming **230% more bandwidth and 70% better power efficiency
  than a standard HBM4e stack** — roughly 100W saved per GPU in a
  four-stack configuration.
  ([TrendForce](https://www.trendforce.com))
- **SK hynix showed i-HBM packaging claiming >30% lower thermal
  resistance, and disclosed it is evaluating Intel's EMIB packaging
  alongside CoWoS** for future HBM-logic integration — a possible SK
  hynix–Intel packaging tie-up in a market TSMC's CoWoS currently
  defines.
  ([TrendForce](https://www.trendforce.com))
- **d-Matrix disclosed Raptor, which fuses DRAM directly beneath compute
  and drops the PHY layer entirely, claiming SRAM-class bandwidth at
  roughly a tenth of HBM's power draw, and hit 105 TB/s in real
  silicon.** Positioned as a complement to HBM rather than a replacement
  — it is an inference accelerator, not a general part.
  ([ServeTheHome](https://www.servethehome.com), Wccftech corroborating)
- **The analytical point: day one said the wall is widening structurally;
  day two produced three independent attempts to engineer around it —
  stack on top of the die (Samsung), re-package the stack (SK hynix), or
  delete the interface (d-Matrix).** That is an industry treating the
  constraint as permanent rather than cyclical.

## 2026-08-22 — The memory squeeze arrives in the data center as a capex story

- **Nvidia is raising AI server prices more than 15% and naming DRAM and
  HBM costs as the reason.** This thread has followed the three-year HBM
  deficit through *consumer* hardware price rises — Apple, Microsoft,
  handset and PC bills of materials. The 08-22 notice is the same squeeze
  reaching the buildout itself: Samsung, SK Hynix and Micron now set the
  marginal cost of AI compute, and Nvidia has said so publicly by passing
  it through rather than absorbing it. All three price-setters have been
  watchlist entities on this map since 2026-07-24 and are already tagged
  in this file's own frontmatter, so the companies at the centre of this
  thread carry entity slugs on this bullet.
  <!-- Corrected 2026-08-23: the original 08-22 entry stated
  Samsung/SK Hynix/Micron "are watchlist search terms on this map with no
  entity slugs" and "cannot currently be tagged," offering it as a map
  change. That was incorrect — all three have carried entity slugs since
  2026-07-24 (see this file's frontmatter: entities: [..., sk-hynix,
  micron]). Sentence corrected above; nothing else in this entry
  changed. -->

## 2026-08-18 — The shortage produces its first visible casualty on the demand side

- **Xiaomi's profit fell on a worsening memory-chip crunch hitting
  smartphone demand.** This thread has run entirely from the supply side;
  this is the same transaction seen from the other end. Datacenter HBM
  and DRAM demand is bidding memory away from consumer devices — **Micron
  crossed $1,000 a share on Monday because it is the seller, and Xiaomi's
  margins compressed because it is the buyer that cannot outbid an AI
  datacenter.**
  ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-08-18/xiaomi-profit-dives-as-memory-crunch-hits-smartphone-demand))
- **This is the first item where the buildout's input scarcity
  measurably taxes a non-AI business's P&L** rather than lifting a
  supplier's multiple. If it spreads to other handset and PC makers, this
  thread needs a demand-side strand: the story stops being who profits
  from scarcity and becomes who pays for it — which reaches consumer
  prices, and therefore inflation prints.


## 2026-08-05 (late catch, added 2026-08-11) — Nvidia tests cutting Rubin Ultra's own memory to cope with the shortage it's helping cause

- **Nvidia is reportedly testing lower-memory configurations of its
  next-generation Rubin Ultra accelerator — designs as small as 192GB
  (stepping back to 8-Hi HBM4) versus the 288GB on the current Vera
  Rubin, a 33% cut** — per an August 4 TrendForce report. Driven by tight
  HBM wafer allocation across SK Hynix, Samsung and Micron, the same
  three suppliers this thread already tracks on the supply side. A
  lower-memory Rubin Ultra means buyers need more GPUs for the same
  workload — more power, rack space and interconnect cost — the first
  entry on this thread showing the squeeze reaching into Nvidia's own
  next-gen chip spec, not just consumer-hardware pricing or supplier
  capacity plans. Missed by every digest since 08-05; folded in now on
  the 08-11 finalize's coverage-critic pass.

## 2026-08-09 — Apple tests Chinese CXMT memory under a Senate deadline not to

- **Apple is testing memory chips from China's CXMT for China-market
  iPhones/MacBooks, days after CXMT rejected Apple's price-cut demands.**
  A bipartisan Senate group (Shaheen, Banks, Schumer and colleagues) has
  given Apple until 2026-08-21 to publicly commit to rejecting CXMT and
  YMTC, both Pentagon-designated Chinese-military-linked suppliers;
  Micron is lobbying against Apple's plan. CXMT can hold firm on price
  because Huawei and Xiaomi have already locked up its output at
  similarly high levels — AI-driven DRAM scarcity flipping the usual
  buyer-leverage dynamic. HP and Acer already ship CXMT chips outside
  the US.
  ([eWeek](https://www.eweek.com/news/apple-chinese-memory-chip-pressure/))

## 2026-08-07 — SK Hynix weighs selling down its China packaging plant

- **SK Hynix is exploring a stake sale in its $3B Chongqing chip-packaging
  plant** as export-control tightening around China-facing memory
  operations continues; potential buyers include Chinese investment funds
  and semiconductor firms, with SK Hynix possibly retaining a minority
  stake. The plant handles NAND back-end packaging — separate from the
  HBM lines that supply Nvidia — and the company says discussions are
  early and nothing is decided. Cross-refs [China's Stack](/threads/china-stack-independence/).
  ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-08-07/sk-hynix-is-said-to-mull-options-for-3-billion-chongqing-assets))

## 2026-08-05 — The 2027 DRAM market closes with no room for a fourth supplier, and Apple's China hedge fails

- **Apple gave up trying to qualify CXMT as a fourth DRAM supplier** —
  months of talks collapsed because CXMT (a Pentagon-listed Chinese
  military-linked entity) would not price below Samsung/SK Hynix, having
  already committed its capacity to Huawei and Xiaomi at elevated rates,
  while Senate pressure (Banks, Schumer) added regulatory-clearance risk;
  Samsung, SK Hynix and Micron have now fully booked their 2027 output,
  with existing customers getting only 60-70% of requested volume against
  advance deposits.
  ([Tech Times](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/323108/20260805/apple-failed-find-fourth-dram-supplier-2027-market-closes-completely.htm))
- **CXMT DRAM is already inside HP, Asus and Acer laptops sold outside the
  US** — sold at prices matching Samsung's (adopted for supply, not
  discount), and flagged as a fresh risk: Chinese law requires CXMT to
  report chip vulnerabilities to Beijing's industry ministry within 48
  hours, before notifying the PC makers using the chips.
  ([Tech Times](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/323114/20260805/cxmt-dram-now-inside-laptops-china-learns-chip-flaws-before-pc-makers-can-patch-them.htm))
- **Samsung and SK Hynix are separately testing Chinese chipmaking
  equipment (AMEC) for their own Chinese-based fabs**, hedging against a
  further tightening of US export controls — testing reported to have
  started roughly two years ago and now surfacing as the squeeze
  intensifies.
  ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/samsung-sk-hynix-test-chinese-chip-tools-hedge-against-us-risks-2026-08-05/))
- 💡 **The "who blinks first on capex" question this thread has been
  tracking now has a concrete answer for Apple: it blinked and lost** —
  it tried the CXMT hedge specifically to route around the Samsung/SK
  Hynix/Micron oligopoly and couldn't get a price advantage even from the
  sanctioned option. The 2027 sellout also sharpens the DoD-ban overhang
  already on this thread's watch: CXMT is filling gaps for HP/Asus/Acer
  and Huawei/Xiaomi while still being too expensive for Apple, not too
  restricted.

## 2026-08-01 — Memory prices become large enough to move a hyperscaler's capex line

- **Amazon raised FY2026 cash capex guidance to ~$220B from ~$200B on
  07-30, explicitly citing higher memory costs** — the first instance in
  this map of memory-price inflation moving a hyperscaler's own capex
  number rather than only its cost line.
  ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/07/30/amazon-amzn-q2-earnings-report-2026.html))
- **Management said even $220B would not buy enough capacity to meet 2026
  demand, and expected the same into 2027-28.**
  ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/07/30/amazon-amzn-q2-earnings-report-2026.html))

## 2026-07-31 — Cook: "a hundred year flood on memory pricing"; Samsung converts a NAND line to DRAM

- **Tim Cook, on his final earnings call as Apple CEO, put the company's
  own voice behind the shortage** — called it "a hundred year flood on
  memory pricing," confirmed Apple already raised Mac/iPad prices over
  it, warned the September quarter sees a bigger supply-driven hit than
  this one, and said "if there were more suppliers, that would be
  good... it's unclear on the pricing side" when asked about
  diversifying beyond Micron/SK Hynix/Samsung — while Apple continues
  lobbying Washington to clear CXMT/YMTC purchases despite the
  bipartisan Senate Aug-21 deadline.
  ([MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/2026/07/30/tim-cook-on-apple-price-increases/), [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2026/07/30/tim-cook-signed-off-on-his-final-apple-earnings-call-with-a-warning-about-a-hundred-year-flood-in-memory-chip-pricing/))
- **Samsung completed a NAND-to-DRAM line conversion at its Hwaseong
  fab**, shutting an older 2D NAND wafer line and repurposing it for
  DRAM — secondary reporting (paywalled primary) puts the capacity gain
  at roughly +15% general-purpose DRAM by end of 2026; a concrete
  supply-side response landing the same day as Cook's warning.
  ([Digitimes, paywalled](https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20260730PD202/samsung-dram-capacity-fab-nand.html)) — confidence: medium, single secondary source on the figure.

## 2026-07-30 — Samsung's Q2 answers the pending flag: chip profit ~250x, phones eat the squeeze, shortage guided to 2028

- **Samsung's DS (chip) division posted ~₩89.2-89.5T (~$62B) operating
  profit, a ~250-fold YoY jump** — while the **Mobile/MX division posted
  its first-ever operating loss** (~₩0.7T on ₩33.2T revenue), citing
  "elevated component cost pressures across the industry." Samsung's own
  phone business is now eating the DRAM/NAND squeeze its chip arm profits
  from — the consumer-price-echo thesis, inside one company's P&L.
  ([Korea Herald] / AP)
- **Samsung locked ~70% of memory output into long-term agreements with
  five major customers** (reported names include AWS, Microsoft, Google)
  and guided the shortage to extend through 2028 — widened past the
  "three-year deficit" figure traced to SK Hynix's Q1 call. ⚠ Provenance
  split: "through 2028" is the figure carried near-uniformly across
  Reuters/Bloomberg/WSJ/Yonhap, almost certainly earnings-call
  commentary rather than release text — strong-secondary, not
  primary-document-confirmed.
- **Bipartisan senators (Banks, Schumer, others) sent Apple a letter
  demanding it not buy CXMT/YMTC memory chips, with an August 21
  deadline** — warning that once a China-market part clears Apple's
  qualification, "extending it worldwide is a single procurement decision
  away." Apple has reportedly already requested to buy from CXMT and
  purchased (unused) YMTC chips. Converges this thread's China-capacity
  strand with the Apple consumer-price echo into one live political
  fight. ([AppleInsider], corroborated Bloomberg/The Information/
  9to5Mac/Business Standard)

## 2026-07-28 — The best print in the cycle's history couldn't hold a bid

- **Anthropic asked SK Hynix for chip supply to build its own custom AI
  silicon, and separately struck supply agreements with both Samsung and
  SK Hynix** — SK Group chair Chey Tae-won disclosed the ask at a San
  Francisco AI summit (Bloomberg, 07-25); Dario Amodei confirmed the
  Samsung + SK Hynix supply deals days later without giving terms
  (volume, components, or duration). Widens the squeeze's demand side
  past hyperscalers to frontier AI labs themselves — SK Hynix also
  participated in Anthropic's May Series H round.
  ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-07-25/sk-chair-says-anthropic-asked-for-supplies-to-make-its-own-chips) ·
  [Digitimes](https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20260728PD201/anthropic-sk-hynix-chips-chairman-ceo.html))
- **Samsung's chip talent is defecting to SK Hynix over a bonus gap
  reported as wide as 100x** — ~200 Samsung engineers have moved to SK
  Hynix since December (SK Hynix pays out 10% of operating profit as a
  profit-sharing pool, fattened by record HBM margins); Samsung won an
  18-month injunction this month against two ex-employees joining SK
  Hynix, citing chips as protected "national core technology." A
  labor-market echo of the same squeeze — the profit differential is now
  visibly reallocating headcount, not just capital.
  ([MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/07/28/1140853/samsung-chip-workers-exodus-sk-hynix/))
- **Then the quarter itself landed. SK Hynix Q2, primary-sourced:** revenue **79.3187T won**, operating
  profit **60.5426T won** (**+557% YoY**, 76% margin), net profit
  **93.9226T won**. A record in absolute terms — and a **miss** against
  the 63.7-64.1T consensus this thread's ledger entry tracked as
  "~$43.7B." Revenue missed too (~83.6-83.9T expected). The net-profit
  beat is **non-operating gains**, not operations.
  ([SK hynix](https://news.skhynix.com/en/q2-2026-business-results/))
- **HBM4 mass shipments began in Q2**, "full ramp" guided for 2H26;
  **~10 customers** signed to long-term supply agreements. Management
  called **Blackwell/HBM3E demand still strong** and said **Rubin —
  which needs HBM4 — is running later than expected**. The shortage
  thesis survives the miss; the timing shifts right.
- **⚠ A capex claim this thread is NOT adopting:** secondary outlets
  reported capex raised to the **~40T-won high end (~45T/$31B)**. The
  release itself says "capital expenditure discipline," phased "based on
  customer demand and investment efficiency." Primary and secondary
  disagree in direction, not just degree — flagged pending the 07-30
  Samsung breakdown.
- **The market's answer (07-29 KST session):** SK Hynix opened up, ran
  **+3.74%**, then closed **−9.61% at 1,401,000 won**. Samsung **+4.55%
  → −5.23%**. Micron had already fallen **8.85% to $820.53** in the US
  session.

## 2026-07-28 — Capacity-race backstory: the trio, plus a same-day shock

- **The trio's HBM race, mapped.** Backward crawl on Samsung/SK Hynix/Micron
  finds SK Hynix still the incumbent (~55% HBM share, first to clear
  Nvidia's HBM4 Vera Rubin qualification, commanding a reported 60-70% of
  that volume) but Samsung projected by UBS to overtake it on HBM
  bit-capacity share in 2027 (41% vs 39%) — Samsung's first-ever lead —
  even though it's still stuck at Nvidia's "paid evaluation" stage for
  HBM4 as of 07-17, no confirmed volume order. Micron is #3 and the most
  exposed to Nvidia's on-again-off-again favor (excluded from early Vera
  Rubin slots in Feb, reinstated by June) but posted the trio's standout
  quarter (Q3 FY26: $41.5B revenue vs $9.3B a year ago, 84.6% gross
  margin) while running a $200B US buildout as the only US-based DRAM
  maker.
- **The "three-year HBM deficit" claim, sourced.** It traces to **SK
  Hynix's own Q1 2026 earnings call (04-23)** — CFO Kim Woo-hyun and VP
  Park Joon-deok guiding that demand will outpace supply for at least
  three years. Company guidance, not an outside analyst estimate — the
  CXMT-thread framing that repeated it (via a 07-27 Tech Times piece)
  draws from this same-origin figure, not a fresh source. DRAM's 2026
  YTD price trajectory stays genuinely unsettled across sources — the
  only claims that clear medium confidence are outcome-side (Samsung's
  confirmed Q2 sequential DRAM +44%/NAND +53%; SK Hynix's ~72-77%
  operating margins), not a clean industry percentage.
- **"Black Tuesday" — the squeeze gets a same-day shock.** CXMT's Shanghai
  STAR-market debut (07-27, +466% to ~$489B) triggered a 2026-07-28 Seoul
  selloff: KOSPI -10.84% with a circuit breaker, SK Hynix -14.65% —
  Korean financial press attributed it directly to investors "refocus[ing]
  on... China's growing competitiveness in the memory... industries,"
  compounding a Wall Street chip selloff and Middle East tension. The
  sharpest, most immediate market pricing of CXMT-as-threat found in
  either this crawl or last week's CXMT-focused one — worth checking
  whether it holds past SK Hynix's 07-29 and Samsung's 07-30 earnings
  prints, or gets partly reversed. Finding:
  artifacts/findings/memory-trio-2026-07-28.md

## 2026-07-23 — The supply side raises guidance too

- **TSMC raised 2026 capex guidance to $60–64B** plus an additional $100B
  Arizona investment; CEO C.C. Wei says demand robust "through
  2029–2030" — the supply-side echo of the same squeeze. Chip stocks
  (incl. Nvidia, -2.2%) still slid Friday on profit-taking despite the
  beat.

## 2026-07-20 — Capital-side marker set

- **CXMT set July 27 for an up-to-$9.8B Shanghai IPO** — Asia's largest
  2026 listing, funding Chinese DRAM/HBM capacity into the squeeze (now
  tracked as [CXMT IPO](/threads/cxmt-memory-ipo/)).

## ← Backstory

## 2026-06-25 — Consumer price echo

- **Apple price hike attributed to the DRAM/NAND squeeze** — The Neuron /
  Rundown AI led with it; we tracked the buildout but missed the
  demand-side cost echo (the gap that opened this thread).
