blurb: 'The concept lived in board glosses; now the evidence supports a thread: a
  federal court ordered broad discovery into UHC''s algorithmic claims-denial process
  (04-23), Minnesota banned AI-alone denials, Congress is fighting CMS''s WISeR AI
  prior-auth pilot, an OIG report hit MA denial rates, and Elevance''s BH "ghost network"
  class action was allowed to proceed (04-01) — the network-adequacy strand. Track:
  the UHC discovery outputs, WISeR''s fate, state AI-denial bans spreading, and Humana''s
  nH Predict suit (quiet, distinct docket).'

## 2026-08-30 — SB 503 (AI bias-testing for clinical-decision-support tools) enrolled, sent to Governor Newsom

- **California's SB 503 — which requires developers and deployers of clinical-decision-support AI to identify and mitigate biased impacts every three years and publish an intended-use/known-risk statement, and explicitly bars using compliance as a discrimination defense — passed both chambers and was enrolled and presented to Governor Newsom at 6pm on 2026-08-30**, the same deadline weekend that produced SB 903's Assembly passage on the mental-health-chatbot side. This is the bill this thread's own ledger item ca-sb503-governor-action (due 09-30) has been tracking; the governor's signature clock now starts inside that window rather than the item remaining purely prospective.

## 2026-08-26 — A payer-facing behavioural-health analytics vendor raises, with CVS on the cap table

- **Onos Health raised $17 million to sell AI behavioural-health analytics to
  insurers, with CVS Health Ventures participating and Aetna already a
  customer.** It markets claims and care-data analysis with a claimed ~6%
  annual reduction in behavioural-health program cost. **Cost reduction is the
  product being sold, and the customer is the payer** — which is why this
  belongs here and not only on the funding thread. Nothing in the reporting
  describes denial specifically; logged as a capability and a buyer, not an
  accusation.

## 2026-08-17 — UnitedHealth's payment layer under scrutiny from three directions

- **An amended investor complaint alleges UnitedHealth shut down an
  internal audit that had found at least $200M in unsupportable
  diagnosis codes.** Filed 2026-08-07 by a Rhode Island public pension
  fund and Swedish asset manager Länsförsäkringar Fondförvaltning AB,
  surfacing in trade press today. It alleges "corporate governance
  failures on a historic scale": directors deceiving investors while
  the company repurchased roughly $29B of its own shares, executives
  rushing the Change Healthcare acquisition to make separation "nearly
  impossible" had the DOJ blocked it, and known security gaps — "a
  deficient firewall and improper access controls" — preceding a
  breach that has cost over $2B. A confidential witness is quoted:
  "when you rush, you miss things." UnitedHealth declined to comment.
  Filing date is 08-07; what happened today is its surfacing.
  ([Healthcare Dive](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/investor-lawsuit-unitedhealth-ignored-governance-cybersecurity-gaps-change/828016/))
- **The diagnosis-code allegation is the one that belongs to this
  thread rather than the business pages.** Risk-adjustment coding is
  how Medicare Advantage plans are paid; an audit that surfaces
  unsupportable codes and is then closed is a claim about the
  integrity of the payment layer, which is the same layer this thread
  watches for denial behaviour.
- **The IRS is separately seeking to significantly increase
  UnitedHealth's taxable income for 2017–2020 over intercompany
  transfer pricing with a foreign subsidiary.** Notices received in
  March, disclosed in a regulatory filing, and not previously reported
  until STAT surfaced them today; the IRS may pursue years after 2020.
  UnitedHealth says its "tax positions are properly supported" and it
  will "pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies."
  No dollar exposure is visible in the accessible filing text.
  ([STAT](https://www.statnews.com/2026/08/17/unitedhealth-irs-probe-audit-targets-foreign-subsidiary-transfers/))
- **⚠️ Recall note: none of this reached the map through a term the
  map owned.** UnitedHealth — the largest US payer, named in this
  thread — had NO watchlist entry until today, so all three items
  arrived via a generic global-capital RSS feed. unitedhealth-group
  and centene were added to the watchlist this pass.

## 2026-08-15 — Aetna's Alma rate cuts land, softer than proposed but real

- **Aetna's reimbursement cuts to Alma-contracted therapists took effect
  today as scheduled, after a partial July rollback — and they're
  state-specific: New York therapists lose 10.6% on a 60-minute session
  (CPT 90837) and 9.7% on intake (90791), New Jersey loses 15.2% and
  16.8% on the same two codes, and 30-minute sessions are untouched
  everywhere.** The two biggest originally-proposed cuts — collapsing
  90837/90834 into a single rate, and flattening reimbursement across
  license levels (LCSW vs. PhD) — are the parts Aetna walked back in July
  after APA/APA Services protested; what actually landed today is real
  money out of therapists' pockets, just softer than first proposed. No
  formal announcement marked the date from either Aetna or Alma —
  confirmed instead by a practice-management blog publishing the exact
  new rate tables today.

## 2026-08-05 — CVS Health's earnings call delivers exactly the AI commentary this thread was watching for

- **CVS Health's Q2 2026 earnings (reported today) named two specific AI
  deployments inside Aetna's claims pipeline** — a second-generation "Aetna
  Claims Assist Manager" (CAM), described as an "AI-powered agentic claims
  advisor platform" that cuts processing time by over 20% for complex claims
  needing manual review, plus agentic AI simplifying call-center
  interactions for Aetna/CVS Caremark members and providers. This is the
  direct answer to what this thread flagged one day early: a second insurer
  giving AI-in-claims commentary in the same operational-efficiency register
  UHC's Hemsley used on 07-15.
  ([CVS Health investor release](https://investors.cvshealth.com/news/news-details/2026/CVS-HEALTH-CORPORATION-REPORTS-STRONG-SECOND-QUARTER-2026-RESULTS-AND-RAISES-FULL-YEAR-2026-GUIDANCE/default.aspx))
- **CVS beat estimates and raised full-year guidance to $7.90–$8.10 adjusted
  EPS** (from $7.30–$7.50), crediting Aetna's continued MLR recovery — the
  release does not connect the AI tools to the guidance raise directly;
  noted here as context, not claimed causation.
  ([CVS Health investor release](https://investors.cvshealth.com/news/news-details/2026/CVS-HEALTH-CORPORATION-REPORTS-STRONG-SECOND-QUARTER-2026-RESULTS-AND-RAISES-FULL-YEAR-2026-GUIDANCE/default.aspx))

## 2026-07-15 — UnitedHealth self-reports the practice under discovery

- **CEO Stephen Hemsley told Q2 2026 earnings-call investors "virtually
  everything" UHC does now runs through AI**, including a 96% first-pass
  prior-authorization approval rate and a committed 30% cut to prior-auth
  volume by year-end — the identical claims-automation UHC is under
  federal discovery over (nH Predict/naviHealth). Optum Rx separately
  cut AI-driven Rx approval times from 8+ hours to under 30 seconds. The
  company is leaning further into the exact practice its own litigation
  disputes, in public, on the record.

## 2026 — The evidence base at opening

- **04-23 — federal court ordered broad discovery into UnitedHealthcare's
  algorithmic claims-denial process** — the strongest legal beachhead yet.
- **04-01 — Elevance's BH "ghost network" class action allowed to
  proceed** (inaccurate provider directories — the network-adequacy strand).
- **Minnesota banned AI-alone denials; Congress fighting CMS's WISeR AI
  prior-auth pilot; OIG report on MA denial rates** — the regulatory front
  widened through H1.
- Background: Cigna's PXDX (ProPublica 2023) still defines the genre;
  Humana's nH Predict suit (Barrows) is the quiet, distinct docket.

## CVS Health / Aetna joins the thread

CVS Health had zero thread coverage until a board-pass audit flagged the
gap — but it was hiding in plain sight: the same congressional inquiry that
already anchors this thread names CVS directly, and Aetna has its own
AI-denial suit structurally identical to Humana's nH Predict docket above.

- **2025-09-22 (ongoing) — Schall Law Firm opens an investigation into
  Aetna Medicare Advantage AI claim denials**: the allegation is that
  Aetna's MA contracts require a medical professional to review
  post-acute-care prior authorizations, but Aetna allegedly used an AI
  program to vet those claims instead — covering denials from November
  2019 to present. This is CVS/Aetna's structural twin of the Humana nH
  Predict suit already noted above; still an investigation/policyholder
  solicitation as of the last update found (04-16), not a confirmed filed
  class action.

- **2026-03 — Aetna pays $117.7M in two False Claims Act settlements**
  over inflated Medicare Advantage diagnosis codes (not AI — human coding
  decisions — but the same regulatory-scrutiny climate). CVS refused a
  Corporate Integrity Agreement, drawing OIG's reservation of exclusion
  rights and 10 years of heightened scrutiny.
  ([Arnold & Porter](https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/perspectives/blogs/fca-qui-notes/posts/2026/03/aetna-pays-settlements-government-intensifies-ma-scrutiny))
- **2026-07-15 — Sens. Blumenthal (D-CT) and Hawley (R-MO) send bipartisan
  letters demanding internal AI records from UnitedHealth Group, Humana,
  AND CVS Health**, over AI's role in blocking post-hospital rehabilitative
  care, citing the same OIG findings that anchor this thread. **CVS is
  named in the identical letter as two of this thread's other three
  entities** — the direct evidence for adding it here rather than opening
  a separate thread.
  ([STAT News](https://www.statnews.com/2026/07/15/medicare-advantage-ai-care-denials-probe-blumenthal-hawley/))
- **2026-08-05 — CVS Health's Q2 earnings call** (8am ET, day after this
  crawl) — watch for AI commentary echoing UHC's Hemsley remarks that
  opened this thread; Q1 already showed Aetna's MLR improving to 84.6%
  with guidance raised to $7.30–$7.50 EPS.
  ([Healthcare Dive](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/cvs-hikes-outlook-aetna-improved-performance-q1-2026-earnings/819462/))
- Adjacent, not merged: Aetna cut reimbursement rates to Alma-contracted
  therapists effective 07-15, drawing a 06-04 joint APA/American
  Psychiatric Association protest letter — a real mental-health-lens
  CVS/Aetna story, but a payment-rate dispute with no AI mechanism or
  MHPAEA citation found, so kept off this thread (full detail:
  artifacts/findings/cvs-health-2026-08-04.md).
