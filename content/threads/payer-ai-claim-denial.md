blurb: 'The concept lived in board glosses; now the evidence supports a thread: a
  federal court ordered broad discovery into UHC''s algorithmic claims-denial process
  (04-23), Minnesota banned AI-alone denials, Congress is fighting CMS''s WISeR AI
  prior-auth pilot, an OIG report hit MA denial rates, and Elevance''s BH "ghost network"
  class action was allowed to proceed (04-01) — the network-adequacy strand. Track:
  the UHC discovery outputs, WISeR''s fate, state AI-denial bans spreading, and Humana''s
  nH Predict suit (quiet, distinct docket).'

## 2026-09-25 — New documents detail Medicare's AI prior-authorization pilot's chaotic rollout

- **Ars Technica reports that HHS deputy-secretary nominee Chris Klomp answered "My understanding is no" at a 09-16 Senate hearing when Sen. Patty Murray asked whether WISeR contractors make more money if they deny care, while CMS's own documents say vendors are paid 25% of averted costs; separately, the Government Accountability Office held on 05-12 that CMS's WISeR notice is a rule that had to be submitted to Congress.** Ars called Klomp's understanding "inaccurate," and Murray afterward quoted a CMS Office of the Actuary memo saying "model participants will have an incentive to deny as many claims as possible"; HHS told GAO the notice is guidance, not a rule. The underlying documents — vendor Virtix's 53% denial rate on 6,096 requests reviewed by late March and Innovaccer's temporary blanket auto-approvals to avoid a launch delay — were first reported 09-15. New here: Virtix's corrective action plan for missing the required 72-hour decision window (some requests took over 80 days) closed 08-14, with turnaround now averaging 1.18 days, and Rep. Suzan DelBene's committee push to force release of more WISeR documents was voted down by Republicans last week. WISeR continues, with plans to expand through 2031.

## 2026-09-24 — The Blues put a $942M price on hospital AI coding

- **The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association said hospitals' growing use of AI coding tools cost its member plans an estimated $942 million more over two years for similar care.** Its claims analysis found the share of inpatient stays classed as medically complex rose from 37% at the start of 2023 to 40% by the end of 2025, about 70% of the increase coming from more than 55,000 extra cases where secondary diagnoses pushed a claim into a higher-paying diagnosis-related group ($653 million, roughly $11,000 per excess case), with, BCBSA says, no matching change in care delivered. This is an insurer's own analysis of its own claims, not an independent study; it follows a March 2026 BCBSA maternity-coding analysis that put similar spending at about $2.3 billion, and the New York Times frames the pair as an AI-versus-AI escalation of the hospital-insurer feud over payment, the mirror image of this thread's insurer-denial story. ([Fierce Healthcare](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/finance/hospitals-use-ai-coding-tools-cost-bcbsa-plans-942m-more-similar-care-analysis), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/ai-tools-generated-nearly-1-billion-extra-costs-blue-cross-insurers-say-2026-09-24/), [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/09/24/business/ai-hospitals-insurers-health-care-costs.html))
- **The Senate Finance Committee advanced Chris Klomp's nomination as HHS deputy secretary 15 to 12 on Thursday 09-24, eight days after a Senate hearing at which, per Ars Technica, he answered "My understanding is no" when Sen. Patty Murray asked whether contractors in Medicare's WISeR AI prior-authorization pilot make more money for denying care.** Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) joined all Republicans in the vote, which clears the way for a full Senate vote; Klomp is currently a senior adviser to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ([STAT](https://www.statnews.com/2026/09/24/chris-klomp-vote-senate-finance-committee-hhs-deputy-secretary/), [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/09/trump-admin-using-ai-to-deny-medical-care-for-seniors-in-disastrous-experiment/))

## 2026-09-23 — The Cigna Group partners with OpenAI on AI tools for complex-condition care

- **The Cigna Group said on 09-23 it is partnering with OpenAI to build AI tools for patients with complex health conditions, starting with cancer care, integrating OpenAI's frontier reasoning models into Cigna's clinical workflows.** Oncology nurses and case managers at Cigna Healthcare and Accredo Specialty Pharmacy will get tools combining clinical, pharmacy, behavioral-health and benefits information into one view meant to help identify patient needs earlier and coordinate care between visits; the companies plan to expand beyond oncology over time. Cigna's Katya Andresen (chief data, digital and AI officer) and OpenAI's Nate Gross (head of health) are named. This is a care-coordination tool, not a claims or denial system — the opposite framing from Cigna's role in the payer-AI-denial fight this thread otherwise tracks. Cigna's own newsroom dates the release Wednesday 09-23; Fierce Healthcare covered it a day later (09-24, 4:57pm) and its own article was unreachable through every transport tried — Digital Health News's republication, cross-checked against Fierce's and Modern Healthcare's own headlines, is cited as a secondary source.

## 2026-09-15/16 — FOIA documents answer this thread's standing "WISeR's fate" watch: staggering denial rates and a pay-per-denial structure

- **The Electronic Frontier Foundation released roughly 1,000 pages of CMS documents obtained via a FOIA lawsuit, revealing high denial rates, long delays and technical failures across WISeR's AI prior-authorization vendors since the pilot's January launch.** Vendor Virtix denied 53% of its more than 6,000 prior-authorization decisions through the end of March — "staggering," per the reviewers who examined the data. One prior-authorization request went unanswered for 83 days. Vendor Innovaccer told CMS before go-live that its software lacked full functionality and hadn't been fully tested; when CMS declined to delay launch, Innovaccer said it would auto-affirm all requests until development was complete.
- **The payment structure is the mechanism this thread's watch line names directly: vendors are paid for the requests they deny, not for denials later reversed on appeal**, and CMS's own quality-score penalty for low scores caps the payment reduction at just 5–10% — a financial incentive to deny that a small clawback doesn't offset.
- **Context on the pilot itself:** WISeR runs in six states (NJ, OH, OK, TX, AZ, WA; ~6.4M traditional-Medicare beneficiaries) across 17 outpatient services, launched 2026-01-01 under CMS's Innovation Center; a Senate effort to block it failed 46–50 on 2026-07-16, so it continues on its scheduled run through 2031-12-31.

## 2026-08-30 — SB 503 (AI bias-testing for clinical-decision-support tools) enrolled, sent to Governor Newsom

- **California's SB 503 — which requires developers and deployers of clinical-decision-support AI to identify and mitigate biased impacts every three years and publish an intended-use/known-risk statement, and explicitly bars using compliance as a discrimination defense — passed both chambers and was enrolled and presented to Governor Newsom at 6pm on 2026-08-30**, the same deadline weekend that produced SB 903's Assembly passage on the mental-health-chatbot side. This is the bill this thread's own ledger item ca-sb503-governor-action (due 09-30) has been tracking; the governor's signature clock now starts inside that window rather than the item remaining purely prospective.

## 2026-08-26 — A payer-facing behavioural-health analytics vendor raises, with CVS on the cap table

- **Onos Health raised $17 million to sell AI behavioural-health analytics to
  insurers, with CVS Health Ventures participating and Aetna already a
  customer.** It markets claims and care-data analysis with a claimed ~6%
  annual reduction in behavioural-health program cost. **Cost reduction is the
  product being sold, and the customer is the payer** — which is why this
  belongs here and not only on the funding thread. Nothing in the reporting
  describes denial specifically; logged as a capability and a buyer, not an
  accusation.

## 2026-08-17 — UnitedHealth's payment layer under scrutiny from three directions

- **An amended investor complaint alleges UnitedHealth shut down an
  internal audit that had found at least $200M in unsupportable
  diagnosis codes.** Filed 2026-08-07 by a Rhode Island public pension
  fund and Swedish asset manager Länsförsäkringar Fondförvaltning AB,
  surfacing in trade press today. It alleges "corporate governance
  failures on a historic scale": directors deceiving investors while
  the company repurchased roughly $29B of its own shares, executives
  rushing the Change Healthcare acquisition to make separation "nearly
  impossible" had the DOJ blocked it, and known security gaps — "a
  deficient firewall and improper access controls" — preceding a
  breach that has cost over $2B. A confidential witness is quoted:
  "when you rush, you miss things." UnitedHealth declined to comment.
  Filing date is 08-07; what happened today is its surfacing.
  ([Healthcare Dive](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/investor-lawsuit-unitedhealth-ignored-governance-cybersecurity-gaps-change/828016/))
- **The diagnosis-code allegation is the one that belongs to this
  thread rather than the business pages.** Risk-adjustment coding is
  how Medicare Advantage plans are paid; an audit that surfaces
  unsupportable codes and is then closed is a claim about the
  integrity of the payment layer, which is the same layer this thread
  watches for denial behaviour.
- **The IRS is separately seeking to significantly increase
  UnitedHealth's taxable income for 2017–2020 over intercompany
  transfer pricing with a foreign subsidiary.** Notices received in
  March, disclosed in a regulatory filing, and not previously reported
  until STAT surfaced them today; the IRS may pursue years after 2020.
  UnitedHealth says its "tax positions are properly supported" and it
  will "pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies."
  No dollar exposure is visible in the accessible filing text.
  ([STAT](https://www.statnews.com/2026/08/17/unitedhealth-irs-probe-audit-targets-foreign-subsidiary-transfers/))
- **⚠️ Recall note: none of this reached the map through a term the
  map owned.** UnitedHealth — the largest US payer, named in this
  thread — had NO watchlist entry until today, so all three items
  arrived via a generic global-capital RSS feed. unitedhealth-group
  and centene were added to the watchlist this pass.

## 2026-08-15 — Aetna's Alma rate cuts land, softer than proposed but real

- **Aetna's reimbursement cuts to Alma-contracted therapists took effect
  today as scheduled, after a partial July rollback — and they're
  state-specific: New York therapists lose 10.6% on a 60-minute session
  (CPT 90837) and 9.7% on intake (90791), New Jersey loses 15.2% and
  16.8% on the same two codes, and 30-minute sessions are untouched
  everywhere.** The two biggest originally-proposed cuts — collapsing
  90837/90834 into a single rate, and flattening reimbursement across
  license levels (LCSW vs. PhD) — are the parts Aetna walked back in July
  after APA/APA Services protested; what actually landed today is real
  money out of therapists' pockets, just softer than first proposed. No
  formal announcement marked the date from either Aetna or Alma —
  confirmed instead by a practice-management blog publishing the exact
  new rate tables today.

## 2026-08-05 — CVS Health's earnings call delivers exactly the AI commentary this thread was watching for

- **CVS Health's Q2 2026 earnings (reported today) named two specific AI
  deployments inside Aetna's claims pipeline** — a second-generation "Aetna
  Claims Assist Manager" (CAM), described as an "AI-powered agentic claims
  advisor platform" that cuts processing time by over 20% for complex claims
  needing manual review, plus agentic AI simplifying call-center
  interactions for Aetna/CVS Caremark members and providers. This is the
  direct answer to what this thread flagged one day early: a second insurer
  giving AI-in-claims commentary in the same operational-efficiency register
  UHC's Hemsley used on 07-15.
  ([CVS Health investor release](https://investors.cvshealth.com/news/news-details/2026/CVS-HEALTH-CORPORATION-REPORTS-STRONG-SECOND-QUARTER-2026-RESULTS-AND-RAISES-FULL-YEAR-2026-GUIDANCE/default.aspx))
- **CVS beat estimates and raised full-year guidance to $7.90–$8.10 adjusted
  EPS** (from $7.30–$7.50), crediting Aetna's continued MLR recovery — the
  release does not connect the AI tools to the guidance raise directly;
  noted here as context, not claimed causation.
  ([CVS Health investor release](https://investors.cvshealth.com/news/news-details/2026/CVS-HEALTH-CORPORATION-REPORTS-STRONG-SECOND-QUARTER-2026-RESULTS-AND-RAISES-FULL-YEAR-2026-GUIDANCE/default.aspx))

## 2026-07-15 — UnitedHealth self-reports the practice under discovery

- **CEO Stephen Hemsley told Q2 2026 earnings-call investors "virtually
  everything" UHC does now runs through AI**, including a 96% first-pass
  prior-authorization approval rate and a committed 30% cut to prior-auth
  volume by year-end — the identical claims-automation UHC is under
  federal discovery over (nH Predict/naviHealth). Optum Rx separately
  cut AI-driven Rx approval times from 8+ hours to under 30 seconds. The
  company is leaning further into the exact practice its own litigation
  disputes, in public, on the record.

## 2026 — The evidence base at opening

- **04-23 — federal court ordered broad discovery into UnitedHealthcare's
  algorithmic claims-denial process** — the strongest legal beachhead yet.
- **04-01 — Elevance's BH "ghost network" class action allowed to
  proceed** (inaccurate provider directories — the network-adequacy strand).
- **Minnesota banned AI-alone denials; Congress fighting CMS's WISeR AI
  prior-auth pilot; OIG report on MA denial rates** — the regulatory front
  widened through H1.
- Background: Cigna's PXDX (ProPublica 2023) still defines the genre;
  Humana's nH Predict suit (Barrows) is the quiet, distinct docket.

## CVS Health / Aetna joins the thread

CVS Health had zero thread coverage until a board-pass audit flagged the
gap — but it was hiding in plain sight: the same congressional inquiry that
already anchors this thread names CVS directly, and Aetna has its own
AI-denial suit structurally identical to Humana's nH Predict docket above.

- **2025-09-22 (ongoing) — Schall Law Firm opens an investigation into
  Aetna Medicare Advantage AI claim denials**: the allegation is that
  Aetna's MA contracts require a medical professional to review
  post-acute-care prior authorizations, but Aetna allegedly used an AI
  program to vet those claims instead — covering denials from November
  2019 to present. This is CVS/Aetna's structural twin of the Humana nH
  Predict suit already noted above; still an investigation/policyholder
  solicitation as of the last update found (04-16), not a confirmed filed
  class action.
  ([PR Newswire](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cvsaetna-medicare-advantage-plans-policy-holders-have-opportunity-to-join-investigation-into-improper-claim-denial-for-post-acute-care-with-the-schall-law-firm-302563551.html))
- **2026-03 — Aetna pays $117.7M in two False Claims Act settlements**
  over inflated Medicare Advantage diagnosis codes (not AI — human coding
  decisions — but the same regulatory-scrutiny climate). CVS refused a
  Corporate Integrity Agreement, drawing OIG's reservation of exclusion
  rights and 10 years of heightened scrutiny.
  ([Arnold & Porter](https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/perspectives/blogs/fca-qui-notes/posts/2026/03/aetna-pays-settlements-government-intensifies-ma-scrutiny))
- **2026-07-15 — Sens. Blumenthal (D-CT) and Hawley (R-MO) send bipartisan
  letters demanding internal AI records from UnitedHealth Group, Humana,
  AND CVS Health**, over AI's role in blocking post-hospital rehabilitative
  care, citing the same OIG findings that anchor this thread. **CVS is
  named in the identical letter as two of this thread's other three
  entities** — the direct evidence for adding it here rather than opening
  a separate thread.
  ([STAT News](https://www.statnews.com/2026/07/15/medicare-advantage-ai-care-denials-probe-blumenthal-hawley/))
- **2026-08-05 — CVS Health's Q2 earnings call** (8am ET, day after this
  crawl) — watch for AI commentary echoing UHC's Hemsley remarks that
  opened this thread; Q1 already showed Aetna's MLR improving to 84.6%
  with guidance raised to $7.30–$7.50 EPS.
  ([Healthcare Dive](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/cvs-hikes-outlook-aetna-improved-performance-q1-2026-earnings/819462/))
- Adjacent, not merged: Aetna cut reimbursement rates to Alma-contracted
  therapists effective 07-15, drawing a 06-04 joint APA/American
  Psychiatric Association protest letter — a real mental-health-lens
  CVS/Aetna story, but a payment-rate dispute with no AI mechanism or
  MHPAEA citation found, so kept off this thread (full detail:
  artifacts/findings/cvs-health-2026-08-04.md).
