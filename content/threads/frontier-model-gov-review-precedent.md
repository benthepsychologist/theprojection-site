blurb: 'The gpt-5.6 gating dynamic made permanent — and it''s all one buildout under
  EO 14409 (2026-06-02): the §3(b) 30-day voluntary access framework (design due ~08-01,
  same window as the classified NSA-led frontier threshold), the Gold Eagle clearinghouse
  (launched 07-14; name not on the official record), and the FINRA-style SRO now on
  Wiles'' desk. Watch: the ~08-01 announcement''s terms; whether an enforcement body
  is named (SRO?); Meta''s exclusion made official; CAISI leadership (3 directors
  in a year — can it run classified review?); the first model actually gated.'

## 2026-08-27 — A court says the government may not blacklist a lab for criticising it

**A federal judge permanently enjoined the Pentagon's designation of Anthropic as a national-security supply-chain risk, finding it was retaliation for the company's public criticism of the administration.** Judge Rita F. Lin (N.D. Cal.) granted summary judgment for Anthropic on First Amendment, Fifth Amendment due-process and APA claims in *Anthropic PBC v. U.S. Department of War*, No. 3:26-cv-01996-RFL, vacating Secretary Pete Hegseth's 10 U.S.C. § 3252 designation and converting March's preliminary injunction into a permanent one — **the precedent this thread exists to watch for, and it runs in the lab's favour.** ⚠️ A separate FASCSA designation under 41 U.S.C. § 4713 remains pending in the D.C. Circuit (No. 26-1049), so one of the two designations survives; the quoted holding language traces to a single AP wire story and could not be checked against the August order itself. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/08/28/judge-blocks-pentagon-blacklist--anthropic-.html), [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2026/08/28/judge-blocks-pentagon-anthropic-blacklist), [March preliminary-injunction order, read directly](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.465515/gov.uscourts.cand.465515.135.0.pdf))

**The trigger was two safety restrictions Anthropic refused to drop in contract renegotiation — no use of Claude for mass domestic surveillance of Americans, and no fully autonomous lethal weapons — after which a Presidential Directive told every federal agency to stop using the company's technology.** **That is the cleanest test case this thread has ever had:** a frontier lab held a published red line against its own government, was punished commercially for it, and won. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/08/28/judge-blocks-pentagon-blacklist--anthropic-.html))

- **NPR's own account of Judge Rita Lin's 59-page order (syndicated across its member stations, e.g. WGCU, KANW, WVXU) gives two direct quotes not yet on this thread**, independent of the single AP wire story this morning's entry flagged as its only source for quoted language: the designation was **"based on a desire to make a public example out of Anthropic for its 'arrogance' in criticizing the government, not based on any articulable basis to believe that Anthropic would actually sabotage its model,"** and the government tried to **"impose sweeping penalties based principally on Anthropic's critique of the Administration's views."** New context also not previously on this thread: **Judge Lin is a Biden appointee**; DOJ's defense reportedly argued AI models are "so staggeringly enormous and opaque" that ordinary hardware-evaluation standards don't apply to them; and Lin had signaled skepticism before this ruling, previously calling the government's position "at odds ... with the First Amendment." ⚠️ NPR's piece does not state whether it read the order directly or is relaying secondhand, so this remains two independent wire characterizations of the same order rather than a primary read — but two independent outlets converging on similar substance is stronger than the single-AP-story caveat this thread carried this morning. ([WGCU/NPR](https://www.wgcu.org/2026-08-28/judge-says-pentagons-measures-against-anthropic-were-illegal-and-baseless), [Fortune, "arrogance" framing](https://fortune.com/2026/08/28/anthropic-pentagon-ruling-rita-lin-arrogance/))
- **Amodei is on record calling the administration's actions "retaliatory and punitive"** (Yahoo News), and coverage continues to describe the government as "expected to" appeal — no notice of appeal has actually been filed as of this pass, and the White House still has not commented. Not a new procedural event; recorded so the record doesn't imply a filing that hasn't happened.

## 2026-08-22 — A lab volunteers for pre-release monitoring, at state level

- **OpenAI asked California to amend SB 53 to require monitoring of
  frontier models under training or evaluation.** This thread tracks the
  gating dynamic being made permanent through EO 14409's §3(b) 30-day
  voluntary pre-release access review. The 08-22 move is the same
  mechanism appearing from the other direction and at a different level of
  government: not a federal executive order imposing review, but a lab
  publicly asking a *state* legislature to mandate monitoring earlier in
  the lifecycle than any current instrument reaches — during training, not
  before release. Its stated reason is its own July sandbox escape.
  ([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2026/08/22/openai-says-california-should-strengthen-its-ai-safety-bill/),
  [Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/2242200/openai-calls-for-california-to-strengthen-ai-safety-laws/))

## 2026-08-16 — The framework this thread tracks assumes labs keep the evaluation capacity OpenAI just cut

- **The Financial Times reported OpenAI dissolved its Preparedness
  team — the unit evaluating catastrophic cyber, bio and
  loss-of-control risk — at the end of July 2026**, the third
  dedicated OpenAI safety unit dissolved in roughly two years (AGI
  Readiness in 2024, Mission Alignment in February 2026); OpenAI
  called it "streamlining" ahead of its IPO. The still-unpublished EO
  14409 §3(b) pre-release review framework this thread tracks
  presumes labs run their own internal catastrophic-risk evaluation
  before any government review engages — Preparedness was that
  capacity at OpenAI, and it no longer exists as a dedicated team.
  (originating report: Financial Times, paywalled; [Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/2237916/openai-reportedly-disbanded-its-preparedness-team-as-part-of-streamlining-process/))

## 2026-08-04 — The White House tells the labs it has no plans to ever publish the framework

- **A deliberate non-disclosure decision, not a delay.** The 08-04
  meeting happened as scheduled (roughly a dozen companies including
  OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia), but the
  administration told attendees the framework "stays known only to a
  select group of companies that may choose to participate," and it
  remains unclear even to attendees whether it is finalized. CFR's Chris
  McGuire: "We can't have secret, voluntary rules to regulate the most
  important tech in the world." Both ledger twins (gov-review-framework-
  announce, eo14409-deadlines's Sec. 3(b) half) resolve passed-silent
  today on this finding; the classified NSA-threshold half stays dark.
  ([Fortune](https://fortune.com/2026/08/04/baffling-white-house-wont-publicly-release-ai-model-evaluation-framework-it-reviewed-today-with-openai-anthropic-microsoft-and-others/))

## 2026-08-03 — The EO 14409 framework gets a date without getting published

- **The White House will present the "finalized" framework to the labs
  08-04** — the Office of the National Cyber Director (Sean Cairncross)
  hosts staff-level reps from OpenAI, Google and Anthropic on Tuesday to
  discuss the Sec. 3(b) pre-release framework, the last day of the grace
  window, even as a fresh check confirms nothing has published (no
  Federal Register notice, no NIST/CISA/OSTP statement).
  ([NY Post](https://nypost.com/2026/08/03/business/ai-giants-anthropic-google-and-openai-to-meet-with-white-house-to-talk-regs-tuesday/))
- **✏️ Correction: Meta is among the invitees, not excluded** — SiliconANGLE
  names "Anthropic, OpenAI, Google LLC and Meta Platforms Inc.", overturning
  the "(Meta excluded)" premise this thread and its ledger entry had carried
  from a 07-21 source; the ledger claim text has been rewritten.
  ([SiliconANGLE](https://siliconangle.com/2026/08/03/white-house-invites-ai-companies-review-new-ai-safety-framework/))
- **What the labs get is a draft to "review," not final terms** — the same
  reporting describes the framework as still in draft with no public
  specifics on submission mechanics, testing metrics or disclosure, and
  treats the 30-day pre-release term as "previously reported" rather than
  newly confirmed.
- 💡 **The exclusion story was the more interesting claim, and it was
  wrong.** A framework that excluded Meta implied a government willing to
  pick winners among frontier labs; a framework that includes all four is
  an industry-wide voluntary standard, which is a materially weaker
  instrument. This thread should stop treating selective participation as
  the precedent being set.

## 2026-08-02 — The EU AI Act becomes enforceable while Washington's own deadline stays silent

- **From 08-02 the EU AI Office and member-state authorities begin
  actively enforcing the AI Act against general-purpose AI providers**,
  with power to request technical documentation, evaluate models, require
  corrective measures and fine up to €15M or 3% of global turnover.
  ([European Commission](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-starts-enforcing-ai-act-rules-and-new-transparency-requirements-2-august))
- **Article 50 transparency rules take effect the same day** across a much
  broader set of systems than the GPAI chapter: chatbots must disclose
  they are AI, deepfakes must be labelled, and AI-generated or altered
  content must carry machine-readable marks.
  ([European Commission](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-starts-enforcing-ai-act-rules-and-new-transparency-requirements-2-august))
- **The underlying GPAI obligations (Art. 53/55) and the GPAI Code of
  Practice as their voluntary compliance route have applied since
  2025-08-02** — the Code was finalised 2025-07-10 and Commission-endorsed
  2025-08-01; today is when the obligations became enforceable, not when
  they arrived.
  ([European Commission](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-starts-enforcing-ai-act-rules-and-new-transparency-requirements-2-august))
- **Meta reversed its July 2025 refusal and signed the Code of Practice on
  Transparency of AI-Generated Content** — the Article 50 code, a
  different instrument from the Art. 53/55 GPAI Code that trade press
  routinely conflates — in late July 2026, days before it bound; Google
  signed the same code on 2026-07-24 while warning added complexity cuts
  against EU competitiveness goals.
  ([Meta](https://about.fb.com/news/2026/07/meta-is-signing-the-eu-ai-act-code-of-practice-on-transparency-of-ai-generated-content/))
- **The Digital Omnibus on AI deferred the high-risk obligations that
  would otherwise also have landed on 2026-08-02**: Annex III standalone
  systems to 2027-12-02 and Annex I embedded-product systems to
  2028-08-02, with Article 6(1) classification rules to 2027-08-02; GPAI
  enforcement and Article 50 dates were explicitly left untouched.
  ([Gibson Dunn](https://www.gibsondunn.com/eu-ai-act-omnibus-agreement-postponed-high-risk-deadlines-and-other-key-changes/))
- **No enforcement action, fine or named-company penalty has been
  announced** — 08-02 is the activation date, not an enforcement event.
- **Re-checked on 08-02: still no Federal Register notice, NIST or CISA
  publication, or Treasury/OSTP statement** on either EO 14409 Section 3
  deliverable, dated 08-01 or 08-02.

## 2026-07-31 — Altman's Washington briefing confirmed; EO 14409 deliverables still due tomorrow

- **Confirmed: Altman briefed Congress and the administration on OpenAI's
  next models — and on the rogue-agent breach, in the same meetings**
  (2026-07-29). Senate side: Ted Cruz (Commerce chair), Bernie Moreno, Jon
  Husted, Raphael Warnock, with Mark Warner (Senate Intelligence)
  scheduled. Administration side: Altman said he'd spoken with White
  House officials about "pacing" AI development, reviewed the EO 14409
  framework, and had a meeting scheduled with Chief of Staff Susie
  Wiles. upcoming.yaml's altman-washington-briefing flips pending→hit.
  ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-07-29/openai-ceo-sam-altman-discusses-next-ai-model-with-us-lawmakers))
- **Nothing new on the framework itself** — checked directly: no
  permanent CAISI director named yet (Arvind Raman still acting), and no
  sign the §3(b) 30-day voluntary-access framework or the classified
  NSA-led threshold has been announced. Both remain due tomorrow, 08-01,
  unchanged.

## 2026-07-28 — Labs push back on the Kill Switch Act

- **CNBC reports OpenAI and Google DeepMind "making their case" to
  Congress as lawmakers weigh the AI Kill Switch Act** — the bipartisan
  Lieu-Moran bill (introduced 07-23) that would let DHS compel shutdown
  of frontier systems at >$500M-AI-revenue firms, fines to $20M/day.
  Direct continuation of the 07-23 entry below; full article text not
  yet retrieved past headline/outlet/date — flagged for a depth pass if
  Ben wants specifics on what each lab is arguing.

## 2026-07-23 — CAISI's third leadership change in a year

- **CAISI Director Chris Fall resigned after just 3 months** (dated
  07-20, analysis landing 07-23) — NIST's Arvind Raman is acting
  director; Commerce says a permanent pick is coming "in the coming
  weeks." Live question for whether CAISI can run the classified
  frontier-threshold review due ~08-01.
- **A bipartisan House "AI Kill Switch Act" + independent-audit bill was
  floated**, prompted by [Containment Breach](/threads/openai-containment-breach/)'s escalation.
  ([US News](https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2026-07-23/ai-kill-switch-bill-floated-by-us-house-lawmakers))
- **Confirmed: "Gold Eagle" is the cybersecurity-vulnerability
  clearinghouse under EO 14409**, distinct from the still-unnamed 30-day
  pre-release review framework due ~08-01 — don't conflate the two.

## 2026-07-21 — Gating gets a schedule

- **White House neared a voluntary 30-day pre-release review deal** with
  OpenAI, Anthropic and Google — announcement expected before 08-01,
  **Meta excluded**. ⚠ roundup-sourced, corroborated directionally by
  Bloomberg.
  ([BuildFastWithAI](https://www.buildfastwithai.com/blogs/ai-news-today-july-21-2026))

## 2026-07-20 — The two proposals surface together

- **FINRA-style industry-funded review body under discussion** — shaped
  with Treasury Secretary Bessent and Demis Hassabis.

## 2026-07-14→18 — Gold Eagle live; "voluntary in name"

- **Gold Eagle launched 07-14** — Cairncross-briefed clearinghouse
  (Treasury/DHS/War + Carnegie Mellon SEI) for AI-discovered
  vulnerabilities; voluntary model submission under a 30-day window.
  ([Insurance Journal](https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2026/07/17/877965.htm))
- **Hassabis called for a US AI watchdog the same day** — screening the
  most advanced models, coordinating industry slowdowns.
  ([Just Security](https://www.justsecurity.org/147315/early-edition-july-15-2026/))
- **Coverage framed it as a de facto access gate** — labs running their
  own access programs (Anthropic "Project Glasswing", OpenAI "Daybreak");
  Sacks: "This is how you lose the AI race."
  ([TheNextWeb](https://thenextweb.com/news/white-house-dictating-frontier-ai-model-access-anthropic-openai))

## 2026-06 — De facto gating begins

- **EO 14409 signed 06-02** — the legal anchor: §3(b) voluntary 30-day
  pre-release access framework (Treasury/War/CISA/NIST, design due ~08-01),
  classified NSA-led frontier threshold, §2(d) Treasury cyber
  clearinghouse, §3(c) no mandatory licensing.
  ([Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2026/06/05/2026-11415/promoting-advanced-artificial-intelligence-innovation-and-security))
- **Anthropic's Claude Mythos 5 / Fable 5 blocked, then reinstated** on
  national-security grounds after weeks of negotiation; OpenAI limited
  new-model distribution to "trusted partners" (the gpt-5.6 gated June);
  Anthropic committed 06-30 to pre-publication threat-intel sharing.
  ([TheNextWeb](https://thenextweb.com/news/white-house-dictating-frontier-ai-model-access-anthropic-openai))

## 2025→2026-05 — Rebuilt voluntary from a revoked mandate

- **EO 14179 (2025-01-23) revoked Biden's EO 14110 whole** — AISI's
  DPA-backed pre-deployment regime dismantled; AISI renamed CAISI,
  operating on voluntary agreements.
  ([Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/31/2025-02172/removing-barriers-to-american-leadership-in-artificial-intelligence))
