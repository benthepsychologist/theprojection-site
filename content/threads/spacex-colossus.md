blurb: SpaceXAI's self-owned training compute (Colossus, Memphis) — the "owns its
  mines" fact that makes it structurally distinct from OpenAI/Anthropic, who rent.
  Track the live GPU count + power draw, the reported scale-to-1M-GPU plan, grid/power
  constraints, and whether owning the mines translates into a frontier Grok. Feeds
  the "who controls the stack" thesis (radar Q1).

## 2026-08-24 — xAI tells a Mississippi court that cutting its gas-plant power would make Grok "largely cease to function" (caught late)

- **A hearing scheduled for 2026-08-24 to decide whether to shut down xAI's unpermitted Southaven, Mississippi gas turbines was postponed, but xAI's own court filing opposing the shutdown states an abrupt power loss "would inflict catastrophic harms on Defendants and hundreds of millions of users worldwide: Grok would largely cease to function, and other cutting-edge AI services would be significantly disrupted."** The underlying suit is the NAACP/Southern Environmental Law Center injunction (amended after discovery found ~30 more turbines than initially disclosed at the site). This is the sharpest primary-source statement yet, in xAI's own words, on how tightly Grok's availability is coupled to the power/permit fight this thread exists to track — a direct answer to whether "owning the mines" is actually load-bearing or a liability. ⚠️ Hearing date postponed; no new date confirmed in this sweep.

## 2026-08-18 — Memphis council takes a first vote to freeze new data-center permits, xAI's existing sites exempted

- **The Memphis City Council passed, on a first-reading voice vote 2026-08-18, a temporary moratorium pausing zoning/land-use/building permits for NEW data centers** while the city studies infrastructure, utility, energy, water, noise and environmental impacts — a second and third reading by the 13-member council are still required before enactment. The ordinance explicitly does not apply to xAI's existing Colossus sites; sponsor J.B. Smiley Jr. said he proposed it after learning via social media that xAI is already building a fourth data center on land it already owns. The Greater Memphis Chamber asked the council to vote no, warning it would hurt the city's competitiveness. This is the local-permit escalation this thread tracks, one step short of actually constraining the site itself.

## 2026-08-15 — Congress presses on the turbines as a fourth data center is confirmed

- **A House Energy and Commerce Committee ranking member demanded SpaceXAI
  turn over records and open Colossus 1/2 to site tours** — Rep. Frank
  Pallone (D-NJ) wrote CEO Elon Musk saying the unpermitted gas turbines
  created "a massive health risk," requesting a full turbine list, internal
  communications, and emissions/power/water documentation by Aug 11.
  ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/07/29/spacex-memphis-ai-data-centers-face-house-energy-committee-demands.html))
- **Musk confirmed a fourth Memphis-area data center ("Minihard"), sited
  next to Colossus 2 and Macroharder**, to run 220,000 GB300 GPUs in a
  denser configuration than the existing sites — while SpaceXAI began
  removing the 69 unpermitted turbines at the Southaven (Colossus 2) site,
  to be replaced by a permanent 1.2GW, 41-turbine power plant; removal
  starts in August and is expected to run through July 2027, so the permit
  fight resolves on a multi-year clock, not immediately.

## 2026-07-24 — Opened + crawled

- **Thread opened** (ben-steer) — answering the SpaceXAI Q1 gap the board's
  dormant posture exposed.
- **The "owns its mines" thesis holds and then some.** Compute ownership is
  real, frontier-relevant (Grok 4 was trained on Colossus), and now so large
  that SpaceX *leases the older Colossus 1 to Anthropic* while training Grok
  on Colossus 2 — ownership became a revenue lever, not just a cost center.
  The binding constraints are power and permits, not silicon.

## 2026-07-15 — The permit fight escalates

- **xAI ran ~59 gas turbines (57 in Southaven) for Colossus 2 without
  federal Clean Air permits**; DOJ (Trump admin) moved to shield them as a
  "national security" asset — a novel federal-cover angle.
  ([technology.org](https://www.technology.org/2026/07/15/xai-59-unpermitted-gas-turbines-southaven-colossus-2/))

## 2026-05-06 — Ownership becomes a revenue lever

- **Anthropic rents ALL of Colossus 1 (~220k GPUs, 300+ MW) for $1.25B/
  month through May 2029 (~$40B+)** — with a side-clause to explore orbital
  compute. SpaceXAI trains Grok on Colossus 2 while leasing the older
  cluster; cross-refs [Circular Financing](/threads/ai-circular-financing-risk/) (Anthropic, which
  "rents its mines", now rents from SpaceX too).

## 2026-04-14 — The environmental-justice suit

- **NAACP / SELC / Earthjustice filed a Clean Air Act suit** over 27
  unpermitted turbines at Colossus 2 (~$124k/day penalties sought); the
  plant could emit >1,700 tons NOx/yr — the largest NOx source in metro
  Memphis, in majority-Black tracts at the 95th–99th EJScreen percentile.

## 2026-02-02 — Absorbed into SpaceX

- **SpaceX absorbed xAI (which already held X) at $1.25T combined** ($1T
  SpaceX + $250B xAI) — the largest merger ever; SpaceX cash flow now
  underwrites the data-center burn. (Corrects our earlier "~$2.1T" figure —
  see [Musk Megacap](/threads/spacexai-public-megacap/).)

## 2025-07-09 — The payoff datapoint

- **Grok 4 released, trained on Colossus (200k GPUs)** — first model to hit
  50% on Humanity's Last Exam, genuinely frontier at launch. The proof that
  owning the mines produced a frontier model at least once.
  ([x.ai](https://x.ai/news/grok-4))

## 2024-09 → 2025-05 — The buildout

- **Colossus online: 100k H100 in 122 days** (Sept 2024), doubled to 200k
  ~92 days later; fully operational at 200k GPUs by May 2025 (150 MW grid
  via MLGW+TVA + 150 MW Tesla Megapack backup), then ~230k (150k H100 +
  50k H200 + 30k GB200) by Dec 2025.

## Scale, honestly — confirmed vs. reported

- **Confirmed floor:** ~230k GPUs operational (Colossus 1), ~250 MW draw —
  now leased to Anthropic, not running Grok.
- **Reported ceiling:** the widely-cited ~555k GPUs / ~2 GW / ~$18B headline
  is analyst-derived (SemiAnalysis), NOT an xAI disclosure — it bundles
  Colossus 1 + the ramping Colossus 2 and mixes live with target. Treat as
  direction of travel, not a live count. The 1M-GPU plan is Musk's roadmap,
  reported not delivered.
