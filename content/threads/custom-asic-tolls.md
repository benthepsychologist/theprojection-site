blurb: 'Broadcom''s two tolls. ①The custom-ASIC co-design book — FIVE majors now:
  Google (a $21B TPU order + the Anthropic multi-GW deal), Meta (extended thru 2029;
  Hock Tan left Meta''s board the same week), OpenAI (Jalapeño unveiled 06-24, no
  production date), Apple (NEW — $30B thru 2031), ByteDance (stale 2024 sourcing,
  unconfirmed) — the explicit COUNTER-case to inhouse-silicon''s diversification thesis:
  "in-house" is largely outsourced to one designer. ②The VMware annuity turned adversarial:
  Tesco pulled 40,000 servers and is suing >£100M. Capex ~10% of D&A — designs, doesn''t
  build. Track: Jalapeño tape-out, the sixth customer, the litigation spread, next
  earnings (~early Sept, unconfirmed).'

## 2026-09-02 — Broadcom's Q3 date firms to today, after the close

- **Broadcom confirmed through its own investor-relations release that it reports Q3 FY2026 results Wednesday, September 2, after market close, with the call at 5:00pm ET.** That firms this thread's "next earnings (~early Sept, unconfirmed)" watch line to a company-stated date. No numbers exist yet — the release lands after this run's window. The three things to check against this thread when it does: Jalapeño tape-out status, whether a sixth co-design customer joins the five already tracked (Google, Meta, OpenAI, Apple, ByteDance), and any updated backlog figure. Analyst consensus previews point to roughly $29.4bn revenue and ~$16bn of AI semiconductor revenue, but those are estimates and are recorded here as context, not as fact.
  ([Broadcom investor relations](https://www.broadcom.com/company/news/financial-releases/64621))

- **Broadcom reported record fiscal Q3 2026 results after Wednesday's close — $29.6bn total revenue (+86% YoY) and $16.7bn AI semiconductor revenue (+221% YoY), both above the roughly $29.4bn/$16bn consensus this map had recorded — but Q4 guidance of $34.8bn total and $21.7bn AI revenue came in just below the ~$35bn Street estimate, and the stock fell about 5% after hours before closing down 3.00% at $356.22 on Thursday** (down from Wednesday's $367.47 close, off as much as 6.3% intraday). CEO Hock Tan raised multi-year AI targets to roughly $115bn in fiscal 2027 and $230bn in fiscal 2028, saying customer demand already exceeds those figures and the binding constraint is fab and packaging capacity, not orders. ([PR Newswire, primary release](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/broadcom-inc-announces-third-quarter-fiscal-year-2026-financial-results-and-quarterly-dividend-302868129.html), [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/09/02/broadcom-avgo-q3-earnings-report-2026.html), [Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/09/03/why-broadcom-stock-dropped-today/))
- **On the call Tan said Jalapeño — OpenAI's custom inference chip — shipped in production during the quarter and the next-generation successor is now "approaching tape-out,"** a real step forward from the June unveiling; he also claimed Broadcom now has "six XPU customers," naming Google, Meta, OpenAI and, as a customer newly counted in its own right rather than folded into Google's TPU relationship, Anthropic — which Tan said is "on track to become our largest XPU customer" by 2027-2028 (scaling from 1GW in 2026 to over 10GW by 2028) on the strength of roughly $21bn in TPU-rack orders placed this quarter. Apple and ByteDance, the map's other two tracked co-design names, went unmentioned; the identity of a true sixth name beyond the five already tracked remains undisclosed. No updated aggregate AI-backlog figure was given.

## 2026-08-25 — Jalapeño's first public benchmarks land at Hot Chips

- **OpenAI and Broadcom published Jalapeño's first performance
  benchmarks at Hot Chips 2026, claiming better performance-per-watt
  than Nvidia's flagship.** The inference ASIC the two announced in June
  was disclosed at 700W TDP, with a 128-chip pod at 1.7 exaflops in
  4-bit and 27.5TB of HBM4, and claimed advantages up to 1.9x
  throughput-per-kilowatt and 3.6x lower latency on SemiAnalysis's
  InferenceX benchmark; small-scale deployment inside OpenAI is targeted
  for end-2026, broader rollout 2027. The June item was a partnership
  announcement — this is the first evidence the silicon works.

## 2026-07-31 — MediaTek buys into the toll layer with a $5B financing budget

- **MediaTek's board approved a $5B discretionary financing budget for AI
  data-center ASICs**, disclosed on its Q2 earnings call — CEO Rick Tsai
  sized the custom-AI-chip market at **$80B by 2027** (raised from a prior
  $70-80B range) and set a **15-20% share** target, against smartphone
  chip revenue down 20% in the quarter. A second serious bidder for the
  toll position this thread tracks, funding it explicitly rather than
  opportunistically.

## 2026-07-25 — A new toll layer: Broadcom and Samsung sign a >$200B MOU through 2030

<!-- DATE CORRECTED: this block was previously dated
     2026-07-30 and its text said the story "broke 07-28". Both were wrong.
     Verified against Samsung's own newsroom release, datelined July 25 and
     using "today announced" language; CNBC, Fortune and US News published
     the same day, and no Broadcom 8-K exists. The thread had accumulated
     three different dates for one event (07-25 actual, 07-28 claimed,
     07-30 filed) — the classic aggregation re-index. -->

- **Broadcom and Samsung signed a memorandum of understanding worth more
  than $200B through 2030** — announced 2026-07-25 at an event in San
  Francisco. Note the instrument: an **MOU, not a definitive contract**,
  which is why no 8-K accompanies it. Three parts: Samsung supplies
  Broadcom **HBM4/HBM4E memory** (the primary driver — HBM costs up ~20%
  in Q1), **Samsung Foundry** runs 2nm-and-below wafer manufacturing for
  Broadcom, and **advanced packaging** (2.3D/2.5D) is included rather than
  merely "expected to extend."
  ([Samsung Global Newsroom, primary](https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-and-broadcom-expand-strategic-collaboration-across-memory-and-foundry-technologies))
- **A genuinely new toll layer**, distinct from the co-design customer
  book (Google/Meta/OpenAI/Apple/ByteDance): memory-supply lock-in plus a
  foundry hedge beyond TSMC-exclusivity. Cross-references
  [Memory Squeeze](/threads/ai-memory-shortage/) (the HBM-cost driver) as much as this thread's own
  ASIC-customer angle.

## 2026-07-06/13 — Apple joins

- **Apple confirmed as the fifth co-design customer — $30B through 2031**
  (8+ outlets converge).

## 2026-06-24 — Jalapeño unveiled

- **OpenAI's Jalapeño went from rumor to unveiled product** (OpenAI
  newsroom): LLM-inference chip, gigawatt-scale target from 2026 — no
  tape-out/production date confirmed.

## 2026-06-17/18 — The second toll litigated

- **Tesco pulled 40,000 servers off VMware and sued for >£100M** — the
  licensing backlash became litigation; "VMware refugees" coverage
  continues through late July.

## 2026-04-14 — Meta to 2029

- **Meta extended the MTIA co-design through 2029** (1GW+); **Hock Tan
  left Meta's board the same week** — resolving the optic.

## 2025-12 → 2026-04 — The Google book

- **A $21B Google TPU order** (Dec-25) plus **Anthropic's multi-gigawatt
  Google+Broadcom TPU expansion** (04-07/08).
