blurb: Google mid-pivot — Verily spun OUT to independence (not wound down); energy
  moved to AI (AMIE, a Gemini 'Google Health' coach, DeepMind bio models). Its MH
  footprint is mostly defensive (Gemini suicide/self-harm safeguards after wrongful-death
  suits); genuine behavioral-health capability is upstream in research, not shipped.

## 2026-09-09 — Nvidia invests in Verily, with Alphabet still on the cap table

- **Verily Health, the Alphabet life-sciences spin-out, announced that Nvidia has invested in it and that existing investor CU Healthcare Innovation Fund II is adding more, as it extends its March fundraising.** Verily lists Alphabet among its current investors, so the "spun out to independence, not wound down" reading on this thread holds: Google's parent is still an owner. The money backs Verily's Pre data platform and its patient-engagement product Verily Me; the companies' October 2025 collaboration put Nvidia libraries and B200 GPUs in researchers' hands and produced a genomics-plus-EHR foundation model, Forecast 1.0. No deal size disclosed.

## 2026-09-08 — DeepMind releases the AlphaGenome Atlas, scaling the research-foundation strand this thread already tracks

- **Google DeepMind published the AlphaGenome Atlas, a precomputed map of molecular-effect predictions for all 9 billion possible single-letter DNA variants across the human genome** — roughly a 1-petabyte dataset, DeepMind says more than 30x the size of the 2022 AlphaFold Database, storing an average of ~27,000 predictions per variant across hundreds of human and mouse cell/tissue types. Open for non-commercial research use from launch, with commercial access on Google Cloud described as "coming soon." DeepMind's own disclaimer: AlphaGenome "has not been validated or approved for any clinical use," and the companion paper says the Atlas and its AVI variant-ranking score can only be part of an evidence chain toward a diagnosis, not sufficient on their own. This is a scale-up of the same underlying model family already logged in this thread's 2026-01 "research foundation" entry below — from a per-variant tool to a queryable public atlas — not a new clinical product, so it doesn't change this thread's standing "reshaping, not retreating" verdict.

## 2026-08-11 — Two new items: AMIE clinical-consultation research, and an Abbott glucose-data partnership

- **Google published new AMIE research showing expert-level real-time clinical video consultations** — a randomized study (100 scenarios, 300 live consultations, 30 board-certified PCPs) where the Gemini/Project Astra-based AMIE system read non-verbal cues and guided virtual physical exams in real time, rated favorably against physicians on history-taking, diagnostic accuracy, and communication. Still research, not a shipped product. ([Google Research blog](https://research.google/blog/advancing-amie-towards-expert-level-audio-visual-clinical-consultations/))
- **Abbott and Google Health announced a multi-year partnership to fold Lingo continuous-glucose-monitor data into the Google Health app**, feeding the Gemini-powered Health Coach; the companies also plan a joint study on future AI coaching features. Rollout described as "later this year."

## 2026-08-05 — First genuinely MH-native Google Health move: psychiatric relapse prediction

- **Amae Health and Google Health Enterprise announced a collaboration
  feeding wearable data (heart-rate variability, sleep, activity,
  circadian-rhythm changes) from the Google Health app and Fitbit into
  Amae's psychiatric care workflow**, aimed at earlier detection of
  relapse in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder
  and severe personality disorders — Amae also works with Cedars-Sinai,
  Mass General Brigham and NewYork-Presbyterian, and the two are
  developing a standardized composite relapse-risk score comparable to
  cardiovascular risk tools. Amae's CMO: "Unlike other areas of medicine,
  psychiatry has historically lacked objective tools for measuring
  disease progression and treatment response." This is a real shift from
  this thread's "mostly defensive" framing — an actual clinical MH
  product partnership, not a safety patch. Verified directly (fetched
  08-04) and independently corroborated via GlobeNewswire, Yahoo Finance,
  Becker's Behavioral Health and MobiHealthNews.

## 2026-07-24 — Opened + crawled

- **Thread opened** (ben-steer).
- **Verdict: reshaping, not retreating — but direct MH product work is thin
  and mostly reactive.** Google's biggest MH footprint right now is
  AI-safety-and-liability (Gemini guardrails after wrongful-death suits);
  genuine behavioral-health capability is still upstream in research
  (AMIE-style dialogue), not shipped. ⚠ WebSearch budget exhausted
  (fan-out) — built via News-RSS/Wikipedia fetch; lower-confidence dates
  approximate.

## 2026-06 — The consumer coach (and its risks)

- **Fitbit rebranded to "Google Health"; the Gemini AI health coach went
  global** ($9.99/mo, May) — then reports of it giving "unhinged" advice
  (June) underlined the safety risk of an LLM in a wellbeing role. AMIE
  extended from diagnosis into longitudinal disease management (Nature).

## 2026-04-07 — The MH-relevant move: Gemini safeguards

- **Google added mental-health safeguards to Gemini after a wave of AI
  lawsuits** — suicide/self-harm guardrails, one-tap crisis support,
  crisis-hotline integration (a ~$30M pledge cited by one outlet); driven
  by a 03-04 wrongful-death suit alleging Gemini "coached" a man toward
  suicide. The single most MH-relevant item. Cross-refs
  [The Reckoning](/threads/ai-therapy-regulatory-reckoning/).
  ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com))

## 2026-03-19 — Verily set loose

- **Verily raised $300M and became independent** — Alphabet dropped to a
  minority stake; refocused on "precision health AI." A genuine spin-out,
  NOT a wind-down.

## 2026-01 — The AI-health research base

- **DeepMind's AlphaGenome** (genetic drivers of disease) + Google's
  **MedGemma 1.5 / MedASR** (medical imaging, clinical speech) — the
  research foundation the consumer products sit on.
