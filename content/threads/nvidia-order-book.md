blurb: The demand side of the chip spend — a ~$1T Blackwell+Rubin book (a management
  aggregate, not audited backlog); the $100B OpenAI deal is dead, and the constraint
  has shifted to supply (HBM4). Watch the per- customer concentration and the circular-financing
  stakes (Nvidia's 10-Q investments in its own buyers).

## 2026-08-07 — Nvidia takes a $3B stake in the power layer under Stargate

- **Nvidia will invest up to $3B in Lancium, the Blackstone-backed power
  developer behind Stargate's Abilene, Texas campus** — $2B initial for a
  ~20% stake, up to $1B more on grid milestones, valuing Lancium at
  roughly $10B. Not a chip order, but the same customer-financing logic
  one layer down: Nvidia now holds equity in the power infrastructure its
  own GPU customers depend on. Cross-refs `ai-circular-financing-risk`,
  `ai-power-buildout`.

## 2026-08-05 — A new demand category: SpaceX commits exclusively to Nvidia for AI compute in orbit

- **SpaceX unveiled Starmind AI1, an exclusive deal to run Nvidia Rubin
  GPUs and Vera CPUs as orbital AI compute** — each satellite carries a
  full Rubin NVL72 rack (72 GPUs), stands ~20m tall with a 75m solar
  wingspan, draws ~210kW average/~250kW peak power, targets a 2027
  launch, and SpaceX has floated a constellation scaling toward 1M
  satellites as a "distributed AI supercomputer in space." AMD shares
  fell on the exclusivity news.

- 💡 **A genuinely new category on this thread's demand side** — every
  prior entry here is terrestrial hyperscaler/lab demand; this is the
  first orbital compute customer, at satellite counts that dwarf any
  single datacenter campus if the constellation plan holds. Cost and
  firm order size are not yet disclosed — treat the "1M satellites"
  figure as a stated ambition, not a backlog number. ⟨daily 2026-08-05⟩

## 2026-07-24 — Opened + crawled

- **Thread opened** (ben-steer). ⟨steer 2026-07-24⟩
- **Verdict: the strongest demand book ever reported — ~$1T in Blackwell+
  Rubin orders through 2027 — but it's Huang's own aggregate figure, not an
  audited backlog, and the flashiest pillar (the $100B OpenAI deal)
  COLLAPSED in early 2026.** The binding constraint has shifted from demand
  to supply (an HBM4 drought). ⚠ WebSearch budget was exhausted (9-crawl
  fan-out) — built from targeted fetches; a few figures are soft. ⟨crawl 2026-07-24⟩

## 2026-05-13 — First-ever $5.5T

- **Nvidia hit $5.5T market cap** — the first company ever — on news Huang
  would join Trump's China trip (~$5T as of late July).

## 2026-04-09 — The constraint flips to supply

- **A Rubin supply squeeze** — HBM4 shortage pushed SK Hynix's ramp to
  Q3'26; TrendForce cut its 2026 Rubin shipment share 29%→22%. Demand isn't
  the bottleneck anymore; memory is. ⚠ reported (TrendForce).

## 2026-03-16 — The $1T claim

- **GTC: Huang says ~$1T in Blackwell+Rubin orders through 2027** — up from
  the $500B-through-2026 figure a year prior. It's a demand/visibility
  number, NOT audited RPO/backlog — no public per-customer breakdown exists.

## 2026-03-04 — The $100B OpenAI deal dies

- **The OpenAI–Nvidia $100B / 10GW partnership is dead** — Huang confirms
  it's not proceeding (citing OpenAI's IPO plans); FT reported the
  abandonment in Feb. Corrects the circular-financing picture: Nvidia's
  actual OpenAI exposure is the ~$30B equity stake from the $110B round,
  not the $100B LOI. Cross-refs `ai-circular-financing-risk`.

## 2025-12 — The backlog + the circular stakes

- **~3.6M-unit Blackwell backlog** from cloud providers; B200/GB200 sold out
  through mid-2026 (Microsoft the lead buyer, Meta >$100B 2026 capex). ⚠
  trade/analyst-sourced.

- **Nvidia's own 10-Q lists customer investments** — OpenAI up to $100B,
  Anthropic $10B, Intel $5B — Nvidia putting capital into its own buyers,
  the circular-financing critique made concrete (CFO: no definitive OpenAI
  agreement).
