blurb: The demand side of the chip spend — a ~$1T Blackwell+Rubin book (a management
  aggregate, not audited backlog); the $100B OpenAI deal is dead, and the constraint
  has shifted to supply (HBM4). Watch the per- customer concentration and the circular-financing
  stakes (Nvidia's 10-Q investments in its own buyers).

## 2026-08-25 — Wall Street puts a first dollar figure on the Rubin ramp, a day before the print that will test it

- **Morgan Stanley estimates Nvidia's new Vera Rubin chips could contribute nearly $9B in sales in the fiscal third quarter ending October, the first analyst dollar figure attached to the Blackwell-to-Rubin transition this thread has recorded.** Wall Street consensus separately expects Nvidia to guide third-quarter revenue up 82.8% year-on-year to $104.2B when it reports Wednesday. The order book's demand side has run for months on Huang's own ~$1T aggregate figure; this is the first outside, per-product estimate of how much of it Rubin specifically is expected to deliver in the near term.

- **OpenAI and Broadcom published Jalapeño's first performance
  benchmarks at Hot Chips 2026, claiming better performance-per-watt
  than Nvidia's flagship.** The inference ASIC the two announced in June
  was disclosed at 700W TDP, with a 128-chip pod at 1.7 exaflops in
  4-bit and 27.5TB of HBM4, and claimed advantages up to 1.9x
  throughput-per-kilowatt and 3.6x lower latency on SemiAnalysis's
  InferenceX benchmark; small-scale deployment inside OpenAI is targeted
  for end-2026, broader rollout 2027. The June item was a partnership
  announcement — this is the first evidence the silicon works.

## 2026-08-24 (late catch, added 2026-08-26) — SpaceXAI adopts Nvidia's Vera CPU and the NVL72 rack, including for orbit

- **Nvidia announced that SpaceXAI is adopting the Vera Rubin NVL72 rack
  architecture — Vera CPUs plus Rubin GPUs — for gigawatt-scale
  terrestrial data centers and for the planned first-generation Starmind
  AI1 satellite.** This extends the exclusive Starmind arrangement already
  on this timeline from 2026-08-05: that entry established the deal, this
  one names the silicon. ⚠️ Nvidia's own release labels the orbital piece
  **planned** and carries a forward-looking-statements disclaimer;
  reported prototype testing is early 2027, so nothing has flown. The
  "first-ever standalone CPU" framing circulating in secondary coverage is
  stale — the standalone Vera CPU launched separately in June 2026.

  <!-- k: surfaced 2026-08-26 while verifying four items the frontier-ai
       coverage critic had flagged as 08-25 misses. All four proved to be
       08-24/08-23 events, three already covered — this was the only real
       increment, and it is filed under 08-24's marker without reopening
       that closed day. -->

## 2026-08-10 — Nvidia recruits Wall Street to finance $500B of demand-side buildout

- **Nvidia partnered with six asset managers — Apollo, BlackRock,
  Blackstone, Brookfield, Goldman Sachs and KKR — on financing
  platforms designed to raise over $500B in third-party capital for AI
  infrastructure, with Jensen Huang saying Nvidia itself can backstop
  up to $125B (25%) of the resulting deals — MOUs, not final
  agreements yet.** Not a chip order, but the demand-side counterpart
  to this thread's whole story: outside capital now being recruited at
  Wall Street scale specifically to fund the infrastructure that
  generates Nvidia's order book, treating compute as a lend-against
  asset class rather than one-off vendor financing. Nvidia shares fell
  on the announcement. Full detail on [Circular Financing](/threads/ai-circular-financing-risk/)
  (sev=major there).

## 2026-08-07 — Nvidia takes a $3B stake in the power layer under Stargate

- **Nvidia will invest up to $3B in Lancium, the Blackstone-backed power
  developer behind Stargate's Abilene, Texas campus** — $2B initial for a
  ~20% stake, up to $1B more on grid milestones, valuing Lancium at
  roughly $10B. Not a chip order, but the same customer-financing logic
  one layer down: Nvidia now holds equity in the power infrastructure its
  own GPU customers depend on. Cross-refs [Circular Financing](/threads/ai-circular-financing-risk/),

## 2026-08-05 — A new demand category: SpaceX commits exclusively to Nvidia for AI compute in orbit

- **SpaceX unveiled Starmind AI1, an exclusive deal to run Nvidia Rubin
  GPUs and Vera CPUs as orbital AI compute** — each satellite carries a
  full Rubin NVL72 rack (72 GPUs), stands ~20m tall with a 75m solar
  wingspan, draws ~210kW average/~250kW peak power, targets a 2027
  launch, and SpaceX has floated a constellation scaling toward 1M
  satellites as a "distributed AI supercomputer in space." AMD shares
  fell on the exclusivity news.
  ([Interesting Engineering](https://interestingengineering.com/space/nvidia-spacex-starmind-ai1-satellite); multiple outlets 08-04/08-05)
- 💡 **A genuinely new category on this thread's demand side** — every
  prior entry here is terrestrial hyperscaler/lab demand; this is the
  first orbital compute customer, at satellite counts that dwarf any
  single datacenter campus if the constellation plan holds. Cost and
  firm order size are not yet disclosed — treat the "1M satellites"
  figure as a stated ambition, not a backlog number.

## 2026-07-24 — Opened + crawled

- **Thread opened** (ben-steer).
- **Verdict: the strongest demand book ever reported — ~$1T in Blackwell+
  Rubin orders through 2027 — but it's Huang's own aggregate figure, not an
  audited backlog, and the flashiest pillar (the $100B OpenAI deal)
  COLLAPSED in early 2026.** The binding constraint has shifted from demand
  to supply (an HBM4 drought). ⚠ WebSearch budget was exhausted (9-crawl
  fan-out) — built from targeted fetches; a few figures are soft.

## 2026-05-13 — First-ever $5.5T

- **Nvidia hit $5.5T market cap** — the first company ever — on news Huang
  would join Trump's China trip (~$5T as of late July).

## 2026-04-09 — The constraint flips to supply

- **A Rubin supply squeeze** — HBM4 shortage pushed SK Hynix's ramp to
  Q3'26; TrendForce cut its 2026 Rubin shipment share 29%→22%. Demand isn't
  the bottleneck anymore; memory is. ⚠ reported (TrendForce).

## 2026-03-16 — The $1T claim

- **GTC: Huang says ~$1T in Blackwell+Rubin orders through 2027** — up from
  the $500B-through-2026 figure a year prior. It's a demand/visibility
  number, NOT audited RPO/backlog — no public per-customer breakdown exists.

## 2026-03-04 — The $100B OpenAI deal dies

- **The OpenAI–Nvidia $100B / 10GW partnership is dead** — Huang confirms
  it's not proceeding (citing OpenAI's IPO plans); FT reported the
  abandonment in Feb. Corrects the circular-financing picture: Nvidia's
  actual OpenAI exposure is the ~$30B equity stake from the $110B round,
  not the $100B LOI. Cross-refs [Circular Financing](/threads/ai-circular-financing-risk/).

## 2025-12 — The backlog + the circular stakes

- **~3.6M-unit Blackwell backlog** from cloud providers; B200/GB200 sold out
  through mid-2026 (Microsoft the lead buyer, Meta >$100B 2026 capex). ⚠
  trade/analyst-sourced.

- **Nvidia's own 10-Q lists customer investments** — OpenAI up to $100B,
  Anthropic $10B, Intel $5B — Nvidia putting capital into its own buyers,
  the circular-financing critique made concrete (CFO: no definitive OpenAI
  agreement).
