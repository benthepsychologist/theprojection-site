blurb: 'Whether the Treasury''s own cash position is being used to suppress long-end
  yields, and whether that becomes the dominant financial- conditions story into Jackson
  Hole. Deutsche Bank called the doubled bond-buyback ceiling "soft-form financial
  repression" around 08-20; on 08-24 CNBC reported the mechanism — a Treasury General
  Account holding $935-950bn, some $350-400bn above the level the prior administration
  targeted, funding the buybacks directly. Commentary has since escalated the framing
  to "fiscal dominance" — a materially stronger claim that monetary policy is being
  subordinated to fiscal financing needs, not merely leaned on. Three dated tests
  land within four days of this thread opening: Lisa Cook''s removal deadline (08-26),
  Jackson Hole (08-27 to 08-29), and Kevin Warsh''s first keynote as Fed chair (08-28)
  — a bond market that has just learned Treasury has been quietly funding its own
  price support. Track: whether the "fiscal dominance" framing holds or fades, whether
  Warsh''s keynote addresses the TGA mechanism directly, and whether any auction result
  or yield move ties back to it explicitly.'

## 2026-08-28 — Warsh never mentioned it, and the curve then moved in the shape that argues against the thesis

- **The keynote this thread was waiting on did not touch the long-end or buyback question, and the silence is checkable rather than inferred.** Warsh's "In Our Time," delivered 10:00 ET, was read directly from the Fed's own released text: the words **"independence," "administration," "buyback," "long end" and "average inflation" appear nowhere in it**, and the single occurrence of "Treasury" refers to Treasury securities as one market signal among several the Fed should read. **This thread's watch line asked specifically whether the keynote would address the TGA mechanism. The answer is no — a resolved negative, not a research gap.** What he gave instead: a refusal to offer a reaction function ("some simple function like a Taylor rule" cannot be "rigorously relied upon"), an argument that forward guidance "has overstayed its welcome," 12-month PCE at **3.7%** and six-month at **4.1%** against a **firm 2% target** with no averaging language, and a substantial section on AI.

- **Every point on the curve rose after the keynote and the belly rose hardest: the 5-year +9.2bp to 4.488%, the 10-year +5.6bp to 4.728%, the 13-week bill +5.2bp to 3.730% — and the 30-year up barely 2.2bp to 5.213%.** **The shape is the finding.** A repricing driven by fiscal or term-premium fear shows up in the long end first; this one concentrated in the part of the curve that prices the next several meetings and left the thirty-year nearly untouched — **a point of evidence running against this thread's intervention thesis on this particular day.** The dollar rose 0.56%, gold fell 3.28%, and the VIX was essentially unmoved at 14.58, which is a rate-path repricing rather than a risk event. Levels read directly from live quote feeds at 15:04 ET, intraday and not closing prints. ⚠️ **No two-year yield is asserted** — two sources disagreed on its sign and neither was checkable before Treasury's own par-yield curve posts after the close, and it is the most-quoted number in today's coverage. ⚠️ A sweep reported the 10- and 30-year as having "dipped slightly or little changed"; the direct index reads show both rose.

## 2026-08-27 — The 7-year prices cleanly, and the "impossible" 5-year turns out to have been read wrong

- **The 7-year note auction (CUSIP 91282CRJ2) came at a high yield of 4.512% with a bid-to-cover of 2.50**, $110.220bn tendered against $44.000bn accepted, allotted 97.63% at the high, price 99.928654. **The award skewed away from dealers:** indirect bidders took **$26.677bn** of the $43.894bn competitive award against direct at $11.833bn and primary dealers at just **$5.383bn**. That is solid demand, and a data point against rather than for the fiscal-dominance framing this thread tracks.
  ✅ **And the two-auction data gap is closed, with the map's own error found.** For two runs this thread could not state the 08-26 5-year because a source returned an amount-accepted exceeding the amount offered. Treasury's own release explains it: the public offering was $70bn, the subtotal accepted **$70,000,046,900**, and then a **SOMA line of $8,998,900,900** — the Federal Reserve rolling maturing holdings into the new issue — lifting the **total accepted to $78,998,947,800**. **The impossible number was never impossible; it was the Fed's add-on, compared against the wrong denominator at this end.** The same structure sits in the 7-year release ($5,656,451,900 SOMA). The 5-year priced at **4.393%, bid-to-cover 2.37**. All figures re-extracted from the PDFs directly.

## 2026-08-27 — Jackson Hole opens; the keynote that matters is tomorrow

- **The Kansas City Fed's Jackson Hole symposium opened under the theme
  "Financial Innovation: Implications for Payments and Policy," with no chair
  remarks delivered.** **Kevin Warsh's first keynote as Fed chair is 08-28 at
  10:00 ET**, three weeks before the September FOMC — stated plainly because
  this is exactly the kind of scheduled event that gets reported as having
  happened. ⚠️ The Kansas City Fed's own page 403'd on every transport, so the
  date and time rest on three corroborating secondary sources.
  ⛔ Separately: **today's scheduled 7-year note auction result could not be
  retrieved** — the second consecutive auction this thread cannot put a number
  on.

## 2026-08-26 — An auction this map cannot state a number for

- ⛔ **The 08-26 5-year note auction (CUSIP 91282CRK9) happened, and its
  figures cannot be reconciled across three sources.** TreasuryDirect's own API
  returned bid-to-cover 2.37 on two separate queries but two different high
  yields (4.28% and 4.393%), **plus an "amount accepted" exceeding "amount
  offered" — arithmetically impossible for a Treasury auction**, which reads as
  data corruption on that endpoint. A secondary recap gives 2.28 against a 2.33
  average at 4.408%. The figures first logged here (4.659% / 2.39 vs a 2.46
  average) match none of them. **Every number attached to this auction is
  unverified**, and the honest resolution is a direct pull of the
  press-release PDF. Logged as an open data question rather than resolved by
  choosing the most plausible-looking figure.

## 2026-08-25 — Thread opened, backfilled from [Fed Independence Fight](/threads/fed-independence-fight/)

- **Opened on Ben's promotion of a candidate offered five times.** The
  case: on 2026-08-24, CNBC's Steve Liesman (citing two senior Treasury
  officials) reported that the Treasury General Account — the
  government's operating cash balance at the Fed — sits at roughly
  $935-950bn, some $350-400bn above the ~$550-600bn level targeted under
  the prior administration, and that this cushion funds the doubled
  bond-buyback ceiling (up to $4bn per off-the-run issue) announced
  2026-08-19. The map had carried Deutsche Bank's "soft-form financial
  repression" characterisation of that intervention since around 08-20
  without knowing what funded it; this closed the gap. ([CNBC via
  247wallst](https://247wallst.com/investing/2026/08/24/bessent-quietly-built-a-950-billion-war-chest-sitting-in-an-account-at-the-fed-now-we-know-what-its-for/))
- **The same afternoon, the characterisation escalated.** Analysts argued
  Treasury eroded its own "regular and predictable" tradition by
  disclosing the doubled ceiling and the TGA mechanism two weeks after
  the quarterly refunding statement and outside the normal deliberation
  channel; Treasury's rebuttal was narrow and factual (no auction
  schedule changed, the first operation is not until 09 September, the
  full quarterly plan was published 08-19). The word attaching to the
  dynamic in commentary hardened from "financial repression" to **"fiscal
  dominance"** — a materially stronger claim that monetary policy is
  being subordinated to fiscal financing needs, not merely leaned on.

- **Three dated tests land within four days of this thread opening:**
  Lisa Cook's removal deadline (08-26), Jackson Hole (08-27 to 08-29),
  and Kevin Warsh's first keynote as Fed chair (08-28) — see
  attention/upcoming.yaml for each entry. None has resolved as of
  opening.
