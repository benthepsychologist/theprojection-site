blurb: 'The ~$750B question posed as a DESTINATION, not a spender: where does the
  aggregate AI capex actually land, on what projects? The taxonomy — chips (Nvidia/AMD/TSMC/Broadcom
  + custom silicon like Jalapeño), datacenters (Stargate, Camellia, Colossus + the
  100s of sites), power (gas turbines, nuclear-for-AI, grid), land/cooling/water.
  Sibling to hyperscaler-capex-big-picture, which cuts the SAME money by spender;
  this one follows it to where it physically lands. Most destinations have no thread
  yet — that''s the worklist. ADDENDUM 2026-08-15: the capex-committed-vs-capacity-energized
  gap now has its first two real outcomes on the record, on opposite sides — AWS''s
  Lusby, MD project withdrew rather than clear Texas- style compliance gates (08-04),
  while Core Scientific, Vantage, and SB Energy formally committed to Abbott''s PUCT/ERCOT
  standards (08-12). Track which outcome the majority of the project queue lands on,
  not just whether the gap exists.'

## 2026-08-15 — The gate produces its first compliance case, not just its first casualty

- **Texas Governor Abbott announced that Core Scientific, Vantage Data
  Centers and SB Energy have committed to comply with his data-center
  standards** (pay for their own electric infrastructure rather than
  shifting costs to ratepayers, reuse their own water, lower Texans'
  electricity costs, avoid disrupting residential neighborhoods, and
  drop reliance on taxpayer-funded incentives) — the same PUCT/ERCOT
  audit-and-freeze process flagged here 08-03. Abbott's office
  explicitly framed AWS's Lusby, MD withdrawal (logged below, 08-04) as
  the counter-example: a project that ended rather than complied.
  ([Texas Governor's Office](https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-announces-core-scientific-vantage-data-centers-and-sb-energy-commit-to-comply-with-his-data-center-standards))
- 💡 **The gap this thread has tracked since 08-03 now has both of its
  outcomes on the record:** AWS's withdrawal showed capex that didn't
  convert to capacity; this is the first evidence the other direction
  exists too — capex clearing the gate rather than falling into the
  gap. Vantage's stake here is its $25B, 1.4GW "Frontier" campus in
  Shackelford County (full detail on [Datacenter Sites](/threads/ai-datacenter-sites/)), so this is
  a large, named site, not a marginal one.

## 2026-08-04 — The capex-to-capacity gap this thread flagged 08-03 gets its first concrete casualty (caught 08-05)

- **AWS formally withdrew its application for a 2,000-acre, ~500MW data
  center campus in Lusby, Maryland** (on Constellation Energy land next
  to the Calvert Cliffs nuclear plant) after local opposition over
  transparency and a commissioner's signed NDA — filed May, dead by
  August, no reason given publicly.
  ([Southern Maryland Chronicle](https://southernmarylandchronicle.com/2026/08/04/amazon-pulls-plug-on-contentious-lusby-data-center/))
- 💡 **This is the gap made concrete, not just structural:** the 08-03
  entry below flagged that Texas's audit-and-freeze could make committed
  capex and energised capacity diverge, with "no node for that gap yet."
  Separately, PJM (the mid-Atlantic/13-state grid operator, unrelated to
  Texas's ERCOT) rolled out its own version the same week — a
  "bring-your-own-power-or-get-cut-off" rule pushing data centers to
  self-supply or risk curtailment starting June 2027 (full detail on the
  [Grid & Turbines](/threads/datacenter-power-grid/) child thread). Two different grids, same
  instinct: hosts are now pricing in the possibility that a announced
  site never energises. AWS's withdrawal is the first actual node for
  that gap — a capex-committed site that didn't convert to capacity, for
  reasons unrelated to power availability at all.

## 2026-08-03 — The destination tree acquires a gatekeeper (caught 08-04, missed on the day)

- **Texas ordered an audit-and-freeze on new data-centre grid connections**,
  directing PUCT and ERCOT to vet every queued project before it can
  energise and to deny connection to any that fails.
  ([Texas Tribune](https://www.texastribune.org/2026/08/03/texas-data-center-project-audit-greg-abbott/))
- 💡 **Meta-thread read:** this thread maps capex flowing down into compute,
  power and sites. Every leaf has assumed the money converts into physical
  capacity at whatever rate the money arrives. Texas — holding a queue of
  474+ GW, ~90% data centres, over five times its own peak-demand record —
  has just inserted a discretionary approval step between the two. Capex
  committed and capacity energised can now diverge, and this map has no
  node for that gap yet.

## 2026-07-24 — Opened (meta-thread)

- **Opened as the destination cut of AI capex** (ben-steer) — gathers the
  clear destination-projects (Stargate, Colossus, Jalapeño) and frames the
  gaps (the chip-spend itself, power/nuclear-for-AI deals, the specific
  sites) as the collection worklist.
