blurb: 'The ~$750B question posed as a DESTINATION, not a spender: where does the
  aggregate AI capex actually land, on what projects? The taxonomy — chips (Nvidia/AMD/TSMC/Broadcom
  + custom silicon like Jalapeño), datacenters (Stargate, Camellia, Colossus + the
  100s of sites), power (gas turbines, nuclear-for-AI, grid), land/cooling/water.
  Sibling to hyperscaler-capex-big-picture, which cuts the SAME money by spender;
  this one follows it to where it physically lands. Most destinations have no thread
  yet — that''s the worklist. ADDENDUM 2026-08-15: the capex-committed-vs-capacity-energized
  gap now has its first two real outcomes on the record, on opposite sides — AWS''s
  Lusby, MD project withdrew rather than clear Texas- style compliance gates (08-04),
  while Core Scientific, Vantage, and SB Energy formally committed to Abbott''s PUCT/ERCOT
  standards (08-12). Track which outcome the majority of the project queue lands on,
  not just whether the gap exists.'

## 2026-09-01 — Reuters puts a hard number on the capex-committed-vs-capacity-energized gap, nationally

- **A Reuters analysis of utility and grid data found electricity connection requests from large power users — overwhelmingly data centers — now exceed 700GW across the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and South, roughly ten times current actual US data-center power consumption**, the clearest national quantification yet of the gap this thread has tracked since the 08-03 Texas audit-and-freeze entry. Texas's own data-center grid-connection requests grew from ~48GW (2023) to 474GW+ (matching this thread's earlier figure); separately, ten major utilities including AEP Ohio, Southern Co. and PPL have logged roughly 270GW of data-center demand requests combined. Pennsylvania's own count is the sharpest single data point: of 100+ proposed data centers, only 20 have applied for the permits needed to actually proceed — after Governor Josh Shapiro signed an 08-18 executive order tightening permitting for projects 25MW and up, joining Texas as a second state now gatekeeping the queue rather than taking every announcement at face value. Texas PUC Chairman Thomas Gleeson, quoted: "When you don't know what is real, you really don't know how to build the infrastructure for it."

## 2026-08-26 — AWS triples its GPU order; the chip destination gets a number attached

- **AWS and Nvidia announced AWS will deploy 2 million additional Nvidia GPUs across 2027-2028**, on top of the 1M+ GPU commitment AWS made at GTC 2026 (already run through early on demand) — plus new Vera CPU-based infrastructure, "some integrated with Rubin, others standalone" per Nvidia CFO Colette Kress. Nvidia's own Q2 earnings release the same evening put its total order backlog above $2 trillion and raised its aggregate top-five-hyperscaler capex forecast to ~$1.3T for 2027 (from ~$800B in 2026) — see [Hyperscaler Capex](/threads/hyperscaler-capex-big-picture/) for the spender-side framing. For this thread's destination framing: this is the "chips" line item of the ~$750B question getting a concrete, dated, multi-year commitment from a single named buyer.

- **Georgia Power announced its 3.2 GW Camellia/OpenAI contract cleared PSC regulatory review at 9:00pm ET on 08-26** — one of this thread's tracked destinations (power + land) getting its last-flagged regulatory gate resolved. OpenAI funds its own infrastructure; the deal is framed as netting ratepayers ~$950M/year starting 2029. ⚠️ Whether this was affirmative PSC approval or a lapsed objection deadline is unconfirmed — detail on [Camellia](/threads/camellia/).

## 2026-08-25 — An $11.3bn Tennessee campus files, with power attached

- **Backers of "Project River" filed rezoning and annexation applications
  for an $11.3bn Bradley County, Tennessee campus pairing a large data
  center with on-site natural-gas and biomass generation.** Public forums
  are set for 09-01 and 09-12 before any vote. The bring-your-own-
  generation pattern routes around the interconnection queue that has
  been the binding constraint at most of this thread's other sites.
  ([Chattanoogan](https://www.chattanoogan.com/2026/8/26/522510/Proponents-Of-Bradley-County-Project.aspx))
- ✏️ **Correction, 2026-08-30: "pairing a large data center with"
  generation is more confident than the developer itself is being.**
  Wright Brothers CEO Mitchell Simpson told the Cleveland Banner on
  08-28 that there is **no confirmed off-taker** for the campus's power —
  "We do not have somebody that is definitely the off taker for that
  power at this time" — and named advanced manufacturing, semiconductor
  production and robotics as alternative end uses. **What is filed is a
  generation-first campus looking for a load, not a data center that
  brought its own power**, which is the inverse of the pattern this
  entry read it as. The forums stand at 09-01 (18:00-20:00 ET, Cleveland
  PIE Center) and 09-12.

## 2026-08-22 (late catch, added 2026-08-23) — Alibaba raises $10.2bn in Hong Kong's largest-ever follow-on, and puts 100% of it into AI

- **Alibaba launched a HK$80bn ($10.2bn) share placement — 710 million
  ordinary shares at HK$112.70, a 3.6% discount to the last close — and
  says 100% of net proceeds go to its "full stack" AI capabilities:
  chips, infrastructure, and model development and deployment.** It is
  the largest primary follow-on offering ever by a Hong Kong-listed
  company and the world's third-largest of the year, after Alphabet and
  Intel. Bookrunners: CICC, HSBC, Morgan Stanley and UBS.
  ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-08-23/alibaba-to-raise-10-billion-by-selling-shares-for-ai-expansion), [Reuters via Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/alibaba-proposes-hong-kong-share-placement-worth-10-billion-4872416)) <!-- sev=major -->
- **The financial context is what makes it a capital story rather than a
  product one:** Alibaba's June-quarter profit fell more than 75% to
  RMB 10.5bn (~$1.6bn) with a $6.6bn free-cash outflow, which the company
  attributes to the rising cost of AI projects and computing
  infrastructure. **A firm burning cash on AI is funding more AI by
  selling equity at a discount** — the public-market version of the
  vendor-financing loop this map tracks on the US side, with the
  dilution taken openly instead.
  ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-08-23/alibaba-to-raise-10-billion-by-selling-shares-for-ai-expansion))
- ⚠️ **Digest-day placement, stated because it is genuinely close.** The
  earliest verified report of this is the Financial Times at 08:33 UTC on
  08-23 — 04:33 ET, which falls **27 minutes inside** digest-day 08-22's
  05:00 ET close. It is bucketed to 08-22 on that basis, and
  cross-referenced on the 08-23 page. The exact HKEX filing time was not
  established; if it is later pinned past 05:00 ET, this belongs on 08-23.

## 2026-08-17 — A named destination gets a physical shape: Pike County, Ohio, 8 IT-GW, built in phases

- **The signed PORTS-Pike Technology Campus deal (Nvidia/OpenAI/SB
  Energy) gives this thread's Ohio site a physical shape and a
  timeline: an initial 4.25 IT-GW tranche under Nvidia's credit
  support, with an option on a further 3.75 IT-GW, for a full 8 IT-GW
  ceiling with OpenAI named as the customer for all of it.** Reaching
  it requires SB Energy and SoftBank to build at least 10 GW of new
  power generation and invest at least $4.2B in regional grid
  infrastructure via AEP Ohio.
  ([NVIDIA](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-guarantees-sb-energy-s-ports-pike-technology-campus-in-ohio-to-exclusively-host-nvidia-ai-compute), [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-joins-ports-pike-project))
- 💡 **This is the capex-to-capacity conversion the thread has been
  mapping since the 08-03 Texas gate entry, spelled out here as a
  phased build with a stated first tranche** — 4.25 of 8 IT-GW
  committed outright, the rest optioned — rather than the single
  go/no-go moment Texas's audit-and-freeze imposes elsewhere on this
  map.

## 2026-08-15 — The gate produces its first compliance case, not just its first casualty

- **Texas Governor Abbott announced that Core Scientific, Vantage Data
  Centers and SB Energy have committed to comply with his data-center
  standards** (pay for their own electric infrastructure rather than
  shifting costs to ratepayers, reuse their own water, lower Texans'
  electricity costs, avoid disrupting residential neighborhoods, and
  drop reliance on taxpayer-funded incentives) — the same PUCT/ERCOT
  audit-and-freeze process flagged here 08-03. Abbott's office
  explicitly framed AWS's Lusby, MD withdrawal (logged below, 08-04) as
  the counter-example: a project that ended rather than complied.
  ([Texas Governor's Office](https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-announces-core-scientific-vantage-data-centers-and-sb-energy-commit-to-comply-with-his-data-center-standards))
- 💡 **The gap this thread has tracked since 08-03 now has both of its
  outcomes on the record:** AWS's withdrawal showed capex that didn't
  convert to capacity; this is the first evidence the other direction
  exists too — capex clearing the gate rather than falling into the
  gap. Vantage's stake here is its $25B, 1.4GW "Frontier" campus in
  Shackelford County (full detail on [Datacenter Sites](/threads/ai-datacenter-sites/)), so this is
  a large, named site, not a marginal one.

## 2026-08-04 — The capex-to-capacity gap this thread flagged 08-03 gets its first concrete casualty (caught 08-05)

- **AWS formally withdrew its application for a 2,000-acre, ~500MW data
  center campus in Lusby, Maryland** (on Constellation Energy land next
  to the Calvert Cliffs nuclear plant) after local opposition over
  transparency and a commissioner's signed NDA — filed May, dead by
  August, no reason given publicly.
  ([Southern Maryland Chronicle](https://southernmarylandchronicle.com/2026/08/04/amazon-pulls-plug-on-contentious-lusby-data-center/))
- 💡 **This is the gap made concrete, not just structural:** the 08-03
  entry below flagged that Texas's audit-and-freeze could make committed
  capex and energised capacity diverge, with "no node for that gap yet."
  Separately, PJM (the mid-Atlantic/13-state grid operator, unrelated to
  Texas's ERCOT) rolled out its own version the same week — a
  "bring-your-own-power-or-get-cut-off" rule pushing data centers to
  self-supply or risk curtailment starting June 2027 (full detail on the
  [Grid & Turbines](/threads/datacenter-power-grid/) child thread). Two different grids, same
  instinct: hosts are now pricing in the possibility that a announced
  site never energises. AWS's withdrawal is the first actual node for
  that gap — a capex-committed site that didn't convert to capacity, for
  reasons unrelated to power availability at all.

## 2026-08-03 — The destination tree acquires a gatekeeper (caught 08-04, missed on the day)

- **Texas ordered an audit-and-freeze on new data-centre grid connections**,
  directing PUCT and ERCOT to vet every queued project before it can
  energise and to deny connection to any that fails.
  ([Texas Tribune](https://www.texastribune.org/2026/08/03/texas-data-center-project-audit-greg-abbott/))
- 💡 **Meta-thread read:** this thread maps capex flowing down into compute,
  power and sites. Every leaf has assumed the money converts into physical
  capacity at whatever rate the money arrives. Texas — holding a queue of
  474+ GW, ~90% data centres, over five times its own peak-demand record —
  has just inserted a discretionary approval step between the two. Capex
  committed and capacity energised can now diverge, and this map has no
  node for that gap yet.

## 2026-07-24 — Opened (meta-thread)

- **Opened as the destination cut of AI capex** (ben-steer) — gathers the
  clear destination-projects (Stargate, Colossus, Jalapeño) and frames the
  gaps (the chip-spend itself, power/nuclear-for-AI deals, the specific
  sites) as the collection worklist.
