blurb: 'The French national champion running two tracks at once: a fast, broadening
  product cadence (chat models into robotics, formal math, safety tooling) and a capital-plus-institutional-anchoring
  push (a pending €3B/€20B round, a French defense framework, Airbus/BMW industrial
  deals). Both serve the same pitch — "open and European" as a market position that
  doesn''t require beating GPT-5.5/Gemini/ Claude or the fastest Chinese open-weight
  labs on the leaderboard. Track whether the ~€3B round (Samsung + EQT, in talks since
  mid-June) closes and at what terms, whether the Microsoft EU-infra deal ever discloses
  a dollar figure, and whether growing Microsoft compute-channel dependence complicates
  the "sovereign alternative" framing. Cross-refs asml (the ASML stake lives on that
  thread).'

## 2026-08-04 — Opened + crawled

- **Thread opened** (ben-steer, crawl) — filling a confirmed coverage gap:
  the board's own actor-doing.yaml entry flagged Mistral as "barely
  tracked... a coverage gap flagged for the next collection pass, not a
  quiet actor."
- **Verdict: Mistral is shipping fast and anchoring institutionally,
  while explicitly trailing on raw benchmark capability.** Five product
  ships in six weeks (OCR 4, Leanstral 1.5, Robostral Navigate, Studio
  Prompts & Skills, Shieldstral) plus Mistral Medium 3.5 (77.6% SWE-Bench,
  behind Claude Sonnet 4.6's 79.6%). The board's "thin — zero specifics"
  flag on the Microsoft deal is now resolved in *shape* (Microsoft rents
  compute from Mistral's own EU datacenters, not the reverse) but still
  unresolved in *dollar figure* — no outlet checked discloses one. Full
  detail: artifacts/findings/mistral-ai-2026-08-04.md.

## 2026-07-28 — Prior board pass (context, not a thread entry)

- **The mistral-ai-node bundle's 2026-07-28 pass** already covered the
  ASML-led €2B round, the $830M datacenter round, and first sight of the
  Microsoft deal, Samsung talks, and EQT talks — see
  artifacts/bundles/mistral-ai-node/provenance.yaml for the board-axes
  sourcing this thread builds on rather than repeats.

## ← Backstory (crawl 2026-08-04 → artifacts/findings/mistral-ai-2026-08-04.md)

## 2026-07-21 — The Microsoft deal announced

- **Microsoft struck a "multibillion-dollar" deal to rent compute from
  Mistral's own European datacenters** (Paris + a Sweden facility under
  construction, €1.2B invested) for Azure customers in regulated
  industries — plus added Mistral Medium 3.5 and OCR 4 to Azure AI
  Foundry. No dollar figure or contract length disclosed in any of 8+
  outlets checked.

## 2026-06-12 → 07-22 — The pending €3B/€20B round

- **Reported "in talks" since mid-June, still not closed as of this
  crawl:** a ~€3B round that would take Mistral's valuation from €12B to
  ~€20B (67% step-up) — Samsung (~€1B, "dual chip-and-AI-sovereignty"
  framing) plus EQT's EC-backed Scaleup Europe Fund reportedly leading,
  with Novo Holdings and Santander also in.

## 2026-05-22 → 05-28 — Emmi acquisition and the industrial AI launch

- **Mistral acquired Emmi AI (~€300M, 30+ researchers)**, a physics-based
  AI company, then launched "Mistral for Industrial Engineering" at its
  first industry conference in Paris (~05-28) with Airbus (5-year deal:
  commercial aircraft, helicopters, space programs), BMW, EDF, and CMA
  CGM as launch customers. The Les Ulis datacenter (Q3-2026 target) was
  announced the same event, framed explicitly as compute independence.

## 2026-05 — Le Chat rebrands to Mistral Vibe

- **Le Chat renamed to "Mistral Vibe"** with new features bundled at the
  rename.

## 2026-04-29 — Mistral Medium 3.5 ships

- **128B dense model** (not MoE), 256K context, vision encoder trained
  from scratch — consolidates the prior Devstral 2/Magistral lines into
  one flagship, the same move OpenAI made with GPT-5.5 and Anthropic
  with Opus 4.7, done here with open weights. 77.6% SWE-Bench Verified
  (vs. Sonnet 4.6's 79.6%), AA Intelligence Index 30 — "competitive but
  below the closed leaders." Priced to undercut every closed frontier
  competitor.

## 2026-01-08 — The French defense framework

- **France's Ministry of the Armed Forces awarded Mistral a framework
  agreement** for the armed forces, CEA, ONERA, and SHOM — models,
  software, and services for intelligence and logistics use, hosted
  entirely on French infrastructure, overseen by AMIAD, running
  2026–2030. **Correction on the coverage:** headlines calling this a
  "$14B AI deal" are conflating Mistral's company valuation with the
  contract's value — actual financial terms are undisclosed.

## ← Deeper backstory (pre-2026, board.yaml carried figures)

## 2025-09 → 2026-03 — The funding base this thread builds on

- **€2B round, Sep-2025, ASML-led** ($1.5B/~11% stake) at a €12B/$14B
  valuation — the first strategic-industrial anchor investor in Mistral's
  cap table. **$830M round, Mar-2026**, seven-bank debt consortium, for
  Paris + Sweden datacenter buildout. Cumulative closed raise: ~$6.2-7B.
  (carried from board.yaml + mistral-ai-node bundle, 2026-07-28 pass)
