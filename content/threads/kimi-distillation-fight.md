blurb: 'The White House (OSTP''s Kratsios) directly accused Moonshot of distilling
  Anthropic''s Fable model to build Kimi K3, plus obtaining restricted Nvidia GB300
  chips via Thailand; Bessent named sanctions/Entity List as options. Moonshot denies
  it; independent researchers call the evidence circumstantial. Lands right before
  K3''s open weights ship (07-27). Watch: any formal Commerce/Entity List action,
  Moonshot''s response, independent verification one way or the other, and whether
  it chills enterprise adoption of K3.'

## 2026-09-04 — Moonshot's Hong Kong IPO target revised up to $3-5bn, new $50bn pre-money round surfaces

- **Bloomberg reports Moonshot is now considering raising up to $5 billion (a $3-5bn range) in its Hong Kong IPO, up from the roughly $3bn target reported on 09-03, and has added Bank of America as overall coordinator alongside the previously-reported CICC, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs.** The same report surfaces a parallel, separate development: Moonshot is reaching out to backers for a new pre-IPO funding round at a **$50 billion pre-money valuation** — a step up from the $35bn valuation set by its August Series F ($3.5bn raised). Bloomberg's own framing stresses "considerations are ongoing and details such as size and timing could change." ([Bloomberg via Investing.com](https://ng.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/moonshot-ai-eyes-hong-kong-ipo-seeking-up-to-5-billion--bloomberg-93CH-2686043), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-09-04/moonshot-is-said-to-seek-up-to-5-billion-in-hk-ipo-this-year) — 403'd direct fetch, corroborated via mirror)

## 2026-09-03 — Moonshot reportedly files confidentially for a Hong Kong IPO targeting $3B at a $50B valuation

- **Moonshot AI has reportedly submitted a confidential A1 application to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange this week, formally starting its IPO process at a target raise of about $3 billion against the ~$50 billion valuation this map has been tracking as a private-round target.** Goldman Sachs, CICC and Deutsche Bank are named as the banks on the deal; Moonshot had to unwind its offshore incorporation structure into an onshore China domicile before filing, per the reporting. The company's only comment: it has "no information to disclose." This lands well inside the map's own moonshot-hk-ipo-filing ledger window (due 2026-09-30, "as soon as this month" per the original August sourcing) and effectively answers it early, pending confirmation on HKEX's own disclosure. ([TechNode](https://technode.com/2026/09/03/moonshot-ai-reportedly-submits-confidential-hong-kong-ipo-filing/), [RTE/Reuters](https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2026/0903/1590165-ai-firm-moonshot-files-confidentially-for-hong-kong-ipo/), [Invezz](https://invezz.com/news/2026/09/03/chinas-moonshot-ai-files-for-hong-kong-ipo-seeks-3-billion-report/))

## 2026-09-01 — Anthropic ships an anti-distillation API restriction and, for the first time, quantifies the campaign it says targets its own models

- **Anthropic disclosed it traced more than 16 million Claude exchanges to distillation campaigns run through roughly 24,000 fake accounts, and named three Chinese labs — DeepSeek, Moonshot AI and MiniMax — as beneficiaries, alongside the Fable 5.1/Mythos 5.1 launch.** This is the first time Anthropic itself has put a number on the distillation activity behind the OSTP accusation this thread has tracked against Moonshot specifically since 07-23; Moonshot is now one of three labs named rather than the sole one. ([Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-fable-and-mythos-5-1), [Yahoo Tech](https://tech.yahoo.com/ai/claude/articles/anthropic-launches-claude-fable-5-182403780.html))
- **Anthropic shipped a concrete technical countermeasure: API accounts opened on or after 2026-08-31 can no longer carry Claude's extended-thinking blocks forward into a manually edited prior-context conversation** — a technique Anthropic says "has also been used to distill its models at scale." Accounts opened before that date are exempt, and ordinary Claude Code/Cowork/claude.ai users see no change; this is the first shipped product response on this thread's own record, as opposed to accusation, denial, or trade-policy threat.

## 2026-08-25 — Moonshot seeks US cloud distribution for Kimi K3

- **Moonshot AI opened talks with Microsoft, Amazon and Google to host
  Kimi K3 under a revenue-share worth up to 30% to the clouds.** Reuters
  reported the discussions as early, with the split, data access and
  token-tracking mechanics all unresolved. It inverts the usual
  direction of this story: a Chinese lab selling *through* US
  infrastructure rather than building away from it.
  ([Reuters, via Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/technology/ai/articles/exclusive-chinas-moonshot-talks-microsoft-075340033.html))

## 2026-08-19 — The Moonshot allegation broadens: three more Chinese labs, and a bill to close the loophole

- **CNBC reports Moonshot, ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent have all been accessing restricted Nvidia compute via data centers in Thailand, Malaysia, and Japan — legal today because US export controls govern physical chip transfer, not remote cloud access.** This extends the thread's 07-23 entry (which alleged Moonshot specifically obtained GB300 access via Thailand) to three more major Chinese AI firms, and names the legislative response: the Remote Access Security Act (RASA), which passed the House in January 2026 and is pending in the Senate — it would extend export-control authority to remote/cloud access, though a separate rulemaking would still be needed to apply it to chips. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/08/19/china-ai-nvidia-chips-us-export-controls.html))

## 2026-08-15 — Beijing, not Washington, is what actually derails Moonshot's IPO clock

- **Moonshot converted from a limited-liability company to a joint-stock
  company in early August and is unwinding the offshore "red-chip"
  entity it used to raise foreign capital, after Beijing tightened rules
  barring strategic-tech firms with overseas holding structures from
  listing abroad.** Reported by the Financial Times (08-08); officials
  reportedly hardened the policy after Meta's acquisition of Manus AI
  raised concern about foreign influence over domestic AI firms'
  governance. Insiders now say a Hong Kong listing is unlikely before
  2027 unless the restructuring — either overseas investors standing up
  onshore vehicles, or selling out and rebuying onshore — clears quickly.
  ([Seoul Economic Daily, citing FT](https://en.sedaily.com/international/2026/08/10/moonshot-ai-overhauls-structure-under-beijing-pressure), [National Technology](https://nationaltechnology.co.uk/Chinas_Moonshot_restructures_in_bid_for_Beijing_approval_of_listing.php))
- **This reverses the trajectory this thread has tracked since 08-03/08-04
  — Moonshot was chasing a ~$50B Hong Kong listing "as soon as this
  month" and had opened final pre-IPO talks; the same listing is now
  pushed out at least a year.** Notably, neither source ties the delay to
  the Kratsios/Bessent distillation accusation or an Entity List threat —
  this is Beijing's own capital-control anxiety over foreign ownership of
  strategic AI IP, a second-order consequence of the same "who controls
  China's frontier AI" question this thread's *Watch* line is built
  around, running on a different axis than the US side of the dispute.
  Moonshot reportedly has ample funding (~$30-50B valuation across two
  rounds, the second backed by Chinese state funds) to wait out the
  delay without urgency.

## 2026-08-04 — Moonshot opens final pre-IPO talks

- **Opened final pre-IPO funding talks**, targeting up to $50B pre-money
  ahead of the ~6-month Hong Kong listing already tracked, riding
  reported Kimi K3 benchmark strength against GPT-5.5/Claude Opus
  4.8/GLM-5.2. ⚠ Loosely dated ("opening in August").

## 2026-08-03 — Moonshot reportedly chases a ~$50B Hong Kong IPO amid the Fable-distillation dispute

- **Moonshot is said to be targeting a ~$50B Hong Kong IPO "as soon as
  this month"** — above its $35B Series F and sitting inside the OSTP
  allegation (07-22) that it distilled Kimi K3 from Anthropic's Fable via
  covertly-owned GB300 servers routed through Thailand; the figure is
  single-source-thin, citing unnamed "reports coming out of China."
  ([Wccftech](https://wccftech.com/moonshot-chases-a-potential-50-billion-ipo-valuation-even-as-trump-administration-accuses-it-of-distilling-anthropics-fable-model/))

## 2026-07-27 — Beijing draws the line

- **China vowed "all necessary measures" against the threatened US
  sanctions on AI firms** over the Kimi-K3-distilled-from-Fable-5
  accusations — tariff lines drawn ahead of the Sept 24 Xi–Trump summit.
  The state response the *Watch* line waits on has begun, on the trade
  axis rather than the export-control one. Critic-caught (benchmark
  miss, folded at 07-27 finalization).
  ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-07-27/china-vows-response-to-us-sanctions-threat-against-ai-firms))

## 2026-07-26 — K3 weights live

- **Kimi K3 open weights shipped a day EARLY** — billed the largest
  open-weight model ever, mid distillation-accusation and mid $50B
  pre-IPO push; David Sacks publicly pushed back on the "Chinese model"
  framing the same day.

## 2026-07-23 — The White House names a name

- **OSTP Director Michael Kratsios directly accused Moonshot of
  distilling Anthropic's Fable model to build Kimi K3** — the first time
  a senior US official has named a specific Chinese lab; separately
  alleged Moonshot obtained restricted Nvidia GB300 chips via Thailand.
  Treasury Secretary Bessent: "sanctions and the Entity List are both on
  the table." Under Secretary of State Helberg called it a "heist of
  invaluable American IP."
  ([SCMP](https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3361625/global-ai-experts-push-back-us-distillation-claims-against-moonshots-kimi-k3-model))
- **Moonshot denies it** — only 15 days elapsed between Fable's July 1
  release and K3's July 15 launch; independent researchers (Redwood's
  Ryan Greenblatt) call the evidence "thinner than official statements
  suggest," circumstantial (K3 self-identifying as Claude at unusual
  rates has innocent explanations — scraped transcripts, leaked system
  prompts).
