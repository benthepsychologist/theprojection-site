blurb: Where the capex lands in POWER — the real bottleneck. Nuclear-for-AI (SMRs,
  Oklo/X-Energy), gas turbines (the Colossus permit fights), grid deals, and the energy-justice/permitting
  battles. Category meta under where-the-capex-lands.

## 2026-08-15 — A pipeline company becomes a named gas supplier for a data-center power plant

- **ONEOK signed an agreement to supply natural gas to a dedicated
  1GW power plant built to serve AI data-center demand** — a ~$100M
  pipeline-infrastructure buildout for ONEOK, disclosed alongside its
  Q2 2026 print (full-year net income guidance raised to ~$3.6B
  midpoint); COO Sheridan Swords said ONEOK is "in late stages of
  discussions with a couple of other opportunities to supply AI data
  centers." First named instance of a midstream gas-pipeline company
  (as opposed to a generator or turbine maker) contracting directly
  against AI data-center power demand — the gas-turbine side of this
  thread's buildout getting a supply-chain layer one step further back
  than the plants themselves.

## 2026-08-07 — Nvidia buys into the power layer directly

- **Nvidia will invest up to $3B in Lancium, the Blackstone-backed power
  developer behind Stargate's Abilene, Texas campus** — $2B initial for a
  ~20% stake, up to $1B more on grid-hookup milestones, valuing Lancium
  (land + power interconnects) at roughly $10B; Lancium is weighing a
  2027 IPO. First time Nvidia has taken a direct stake in a power
  developer rather than a data-center operator or a lab — extends the
  "compute landlord" pattern one layer further down. Cross-refs
  [Circular Financing](/threads/ai-circular-financing-risk/), [Nvidia's Order Book](/threads/nvidia-order-book/).

## 2026-08-05 — PJM's mirror to the Texas freeze: bring your own power, or the states cut you off

- **PJM (the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid operator — separate from Texas's
  ERCOT) rolled out an "Interim Resource Adequacy Service": data centers
  of 50MW+ must line up their own power (bilateral deals with generators,
  storage, demand-response) or face curtailment starting June 2027**,
  with enforcement pushed onto individual states since PJM itself can't
  mandate curtailment. Driven by capacity-auction costs hitting $16.4B in
  June and 30-34GW of new data-center demand forecast by the early 2030s.
  Full detail on the [Grid & Turbines](/threads/datacenter-power-grid/) child thread.
  ([Canary Media](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/data-centers/pjm-data-center-plan))
- 💡 Same instinct as the Texas PUCT/ERCOT freeze below, independently
  arrived at by a different grid operator in the same week — the buildout
  is now hitting a self-supply-or-get-cut-off wall on two separate US
  grids at once.

## 2026-08-04 — Datacenter operators tap banks for billions to unlock grid connections

- **Letters-of-credit deals (~$10B currently in discussion)** meant to
  reassure utilities that ratepayers won't be left holding
  infrastructure costs if an AI-datacenter project fails — real
  financing stress underneath the buildout, and a direct echo of the
  Texas PUCT/ERCOT freeze below.

## 2026-08-03 — Texas freezes new AI-datacenter grid connections pending an audit (caught 08-04, missed on the day)

- **Governor Abbott ordered the Public Utility Commission of Texas and
  ERCOT to audit every data centre seeking a grid connection before it can
  energise** — covering tax incentives, power consumption, water use,
  community-impact mitigation and ownership — with the directive that "any
  project that fails to comply... must be denied connection to the Texas
  grid."
  ([Texas Tribune](https://www.texastribune.org/2026/08/03/texas-data-center-project-audit-greg-abbott/))
- **ERCOT paused its "Batch Zero" transmission planning study in response**
  — the first cohort already moving through its revised approval process,
  now halted mid-review.
- **The queue this lands on: 1,800+ projects requesting 474+ GW, ~90% of it
  data centres — more than five times the grid's all-time peak-demand
  record**, against 335 operating and 248 planned facilities statewide.
- 💡 **Why this thread should treat it as a step-change, not another
  permitting fight:** every prior entry here tracked power being *procured*
  — nuclear PPAs, gas turbines, DOE site conversions. This is the first
  time the *interconnection itself* has been withheld as policy, by the
  state hosting the largest share of the queue. The binding constraint
  moved from generation to permission.
- ⚠️ **Process note, kept deliberately:** this published 08-03 13:12 CT and
  **12 items on it sat in that day's own collector buffer routed to no
  thread**. Curation missed it; the overnight extension pass caught it. A
  detection failure, not a sourcing one.

## 2026-07-30 — Catch-up: a second Cold War DOE site becomes a $100B AI power build (event 07-28/29, missed at the time)

- **NextEra and Brookfield will develop a $100B AI data-center campus at
  DOE's Paducah, KY site** — a former Cold War uranium-enrichment plant —
  paired with 4.6GW of dedicated power generation. Announced via DOE's
  own release 07-29, corroborated same-day by Reuters/WSJ/FT/Bloomberg;
  this thread's most recent entry (07-27 crawl) doesn't have it.
  ([POWER Magazine])
- **No hyperscaler/lab tenant named** — unlike Stargate/Portsmouth
  (OpenAI), every account frames this as a NextEra/Brookfield-led
  speculative build. Open gap.
- 💡 **Worth the curator's own eyes:** this is a *second* former-DOE-
  nuclear-site-to-AI-campus conversion inside one week (after
  Portsmouth/Piketon, 10GW/OpenAI, flagged 07-28) — a possible pattern,
  not tagged sev= per the rarity discipline but flagged plainly.

## 2026-07-27 — The power book, four actors

- **Google:** solar-dominant (TotalEnergies 1GW/28TWh · Clearway 1.17GW) +
  TVA/Kairos — the first US Gen-IV utility PPA (2030).
- **Microsoft:** TMI/Crane restart tracking 2027 (DOE $1B loan, NRC/FERC
  cleared) · Chevron Kilby $7B/2.7GW/20yr · ~40GW renewables claimed
  (secondary, unreconciled vs a 34GW figure).
- **Amazon:** Talen/Susquehanna 1.92GW firm 17-yr (~$18B, restructured to
  dodge the FERC kill) · X-Energy SMR option to 5GW-by-2039.
- **Meta — the reversal:** QUIT RE100, pivoting to a 7.5GW GAS buildout
  (07-23/24) even while holding a ≤6.6GW nuclear RFP (Oklo/TerraPower/
  Vistra) + NextEra 2.3GW solar. The clean-power consensus broke first
  at Meta.
