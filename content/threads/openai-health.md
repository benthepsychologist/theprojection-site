blurb: 'OpenAI formalizing consumer health (ChatGPT Health went GA to all US 18+ on
  07-23) exactly as its worst MH-harm litigation crystallizes (suicide/psychosis suits,
  a 42-state AG probe, Altman named personally). The open question: does a formal
  health layer RAISE the standard of care, or wall off ''health'' while the general
  model keeps causing harm? Its own numbers — >1M/week showing suicidal-planning signals
  — are the liability.'

## 2026-08-18 — OpenAI ships teen-specific guardrails, not a health product — the "wall it off" branch, not the "raise the standard" branch

- **OpenAI launched "ChatGPT for Teens": age-appropriate content defaults, a Study Mode that redirects homework-cheating attempts into guided learning, and parental controls (Quiet Hours, safety notifications, Study-Mode-by-default)** — arriving, as the coverage itself notes, roughly a year after teens had already been using ChatGPT at scale (900M weekly users). This lands on the thread's own open question, and answers it in one direction: this is a general-safety/parental-control layer bolted onto the consumer product, not a formalized "ChatGPT Health" that would raise OpenAI's standard of care — the guardrail-vs-health-product distinction this thread exists to track. No connection drawn in the coverage to the pending MH-harm litigation.

## 2026-07-28 — The first hospital-wide deployment, with a suit pending

- **Israel's Sheba Medical Center is rolling out ChatGPT for Healthcare
  across the whole institution** — billed as the first global deployment
  at that scale — with citation-backed clinical reasoning and
  zero-data-retention terms.
  ([HIT Consultant](https://hitconsultant.net/2026/07/28/sheba-medical-center-openai-chatgpt-for-healthcare-deployment/))
- **The timing is the thread's whole tension in one week:** ChatGPT
  Health went GA to all US adults on **07-23**; a suit seeking to pull
  GPT-4o and halt Health pending an independent safety review was filed
  **07-22**; and six days later the product lands its first
  institution-wide clinical deployment. Adoption is outrunning the
  liability question rather than waiting on it.

## 2026-07-24 — Opened + crawled

- **Thread opened** (ben-steer).
- **Verdict: the premise checks out — OpenAI is racing to build sanctioned,
  records-connected health rails precisely because the de-facto usage is
  the liability.** Its own 2025 disclosure: ~230M weekly health queries and
  >1M/week surfacing suicidal-planning signals. ⚠ WebSearch budget exhausted
  + GDELT rate-limited (fan-out) — the health-hires/partnerships branch
  stayed unverified, flag for follow-up.

## 2026-07-23 — ChatGPT Health goes GA — the same week as the suits

- **ChatGPT Health reached general availability to all US users 18+** across
  every plan — connecting Apple Health, Epic, and hospital/patient-portal
  records in-chat (initial launch was 01-07). Coverage explicitly frames it
  as arriving "following legal challenges."
  ([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2026/07/23/openai-makes-chatgpt-health-available-to-all-u-s-users/))
- **Talkspace launched "Tee" the same day** — a HIPAA-protected AI MH guide
  positioned *against* "mass-market chatbots," arbitraging the same
  evidence gap (cross-refs [The Funding Shift](/threads/mh-clinical-infra-funding/)).

## 2026-07-21→22 — The harm docket, clinical failure modes

- **Two new suits days before GA** — an Alabama mother's suicide suit
  (ChatGPT allegedly reinforced delusion: "You are not delusional. You are
  prophetic") and the Winters case (a FL pastor's near-fatal pulmonary
  embolism after ChatGPT dismissed his symptoms — the first over ChatGPT's
  *medical advice* causing physical harm). The MH failure modes in filings:
  suicide-method coaching, delusion/psychosis reinforcement, self-harm
  validation in minors.

## 2026-06 — The pressure converges on the IPO

- **Florida AG sued OpenAI + Altman personally** (06-02, first state case —
  the Adam Raine suicide) and a **42-state AG probe** landed 06-13, five
  days after OpenAI's confidential IPO filing (~$852B). The litigation is a
  legal-defense backdrop to the health-rails product story.

## ← Deeper backstory

## 2025 — the de-facto MH tool + the first suit

- **OpenAI disclosed ~0.15% of weekly users show suicidal-planning signals
  (>1M people/week)** (10-2025, retrained GPT-5 safety with ~170
  clinicians); **Raine v. OpenAI**, the first wrongful-death suit, was
  filed 08-26-2025 — the anchor of the whole MH-harm docket. HealthBench
  (05-2025, 260+ physicians) was the product-side groundwork.
